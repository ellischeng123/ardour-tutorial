The simplest way is to save the entire session just like you would save other documents: hitting Ctrl+S.
A new session is first saved at the moment you create it. While you are working on it, you should save it frequently. Get into the habit of hitting Ctrl+S (or Command+S on a Mac) every few minutes.</description></item><item><title>Saving a snapshot</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/saving-sessions/saving-a-snapshot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/saving-sessions/saving-a-snapshot/</guid><description>A snapshot is a representation of the current state of a session at some point in time. In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s like versioning your project by giving every version a meaningful name.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you recorded a song in your home studio and you are trying different arrangements to see which one works best. Instead of creating multiple sessions and copying files between them, you can make snapshots every time you think you have something worth preserving.</description></item><item><title>Saving a template</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/saving-sessions/saving-a-template/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/saving-sessions/saving-a-template/</guid><description>If you often go through the motions of setting up the same information in each new Session you create, such as the number of input and output Channels, the number and names of Tracks or Busses, or the Routing, then you may wish to create a Template of that information instead.
With a Template, you can save the state of a currently open Session without all the Region information files. Templates are useful if, for example, you&amp;rsquo;re doing extensive Routing on Tracks and Buses and want to save the Editor Window&amp;rsquo;s state for use in other Sessions.</description></item></channel></rss>
