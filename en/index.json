We assume that you have read the chapters in the Getting Started section already, and are familiar with Importing Audio, Tracks, and the Timeline.\nImporting Samples The first step is to add some sounds, which is discussed at length in the Importing Audio chapter. Here, we are using the Add existing media dialog (\u0026quot;Ctrl\u0026quot; + \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo;) to import some drumkit samples as regions. The samples used in this tutorial were obtained from a sample pack from the freesound.org website (Nord Drum Mini Kit sample pack, which you can download here).\nAfter importing a few sounds from the downloaded sample pack (bass drum, snare, hi-hat, clap), our session looks like this (in this case I used the \u0026ldquo;Add files as new tracks\u0026rdquo; option, and inserted \u0026ldquo;at session start\u0026rdquo;. The drumkit samples appear as new individual tracks in the Editor Window, each with the name of the audio file used. If the file names are too long or obscure, you may want to rename your tracks for clarity.\nOrganizing the Tracks Now we rename the tracks so we can quickly see the location of each instrument (double-click on the track name to edit it).\nYou may also wish to rearrange the order of the tracks from top to bottom in the editor window. Do that by clicking the Tracks \u0026amp; Busses tab at the far right of the Editor Window and drag-and-dropping the tracks in the order you want.\nYou can also use the V check boxes in this tab to view or hide Tracks in the Main Canvas.\n Here we have ordered the drumkit so that the kick drum is on the bottom, the snare and high hat are in the middle, and the clap is on top.Â Continuing In the next step we will learn about Setting Up the Meter to organize these samples into a rhythm.\nNext: SETTING UP THE METER\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/introduction/conventions/","title":"Conventions","tags":[],"description":"Conventions used in this Ardour tutorial","content":"Below are some basic conventions we have adopted in this manual.\nMouse Clicks Ardour requires a two-button mouse to run (or the emulation of that on your system in some other way). A click is assumed to be a left button mouse click. A right-click refers to the right-hand button on the mouse. A Ctrl, Cmd or Apple key pressed with a mouse click is not the same and may in fact give a different result.\nKey Names \u0026amp; Combinations The names of keys to be pressed are written in quotation marks and italicised, like this:\nCtrl, Return, Backspace, R\nKey combinations are written like this:\nCtrl + X\nor\nApple + X\nMenu Navigation Many functions are accessible in Ardour by clicking on the various menu items. Additionally, you may need to access functions through the menus of macOS, Ubuntu or other Linux distributions. To illustrate this, we use two conventions: the first is illustration via screenshots (images), and the second is through a syntax like this :\nView \u0026gt; Zoom \u0026gt; Zoom to Session\nThe above example is shorthand for \u0026ldquo;first click on the View menu, then choose the Zoom item of the list, and then click on Zoom to Session\u0026rdquo;.\nGlossary Words This tutorial does not assume any previous knowledge of computers or audio editing, so terms which might be unfamiliar to the general reader are capitalized throughout this manual, and are listed in boldface the first time they are used in a chapter. Glossary words are also defined in-line the first time they occur in the manual, and are included in the glossary at the end of this tutorial.\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/exporting-sessions/exporting-a-region/","title":"Exporting regions","tags":[],"description":"","content":"You may wish to Export only a Region of your Session, perhaps to use as a sample in another application, or to Edit it in a different editor program. This chapter shows you how.\nExporting a Region To Export a Region, select it (so it becomes blue), and then right-click into the sub-menu Export, or use the top menu: Region \u0026gt; Export.\nThis will open up the same Export dialog box explained in the Exporting a Session chapter. Choose your options, and click \u0026ldquo;Export\u0026rdquo;. Only the selected Region will be exported.\nPlease note that when exporting a Region, not all parameters and edits are exported. Trimmed, split, stretched and reversed regions can be exported, but edits such as and Panning, and Automation are not exported. Also, the volume of the audio Track itself or the Master Bus will not affect the exported file. To export these edits, please see the chapters on Exporting a Range and Exporting a Session.\nExporting Several Regions At Once If you are building a collection of samples to use later in another software, and your samples are basically trimmed and edited Regions, at the end of the process you will need to export all of them. If the number is large, exporting them manually can be tedious. Here\u0026rsquo;s one way of exporting several Regions at once.\n In Grab Mode (shortcut \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo;), select all the Regions you want to Export. They do not need to be on the same Track.   Go to menu Region \u0026gt; Ranges and choose Add Range Marker Per Region.   Ardour has now just created Range Markers that fit exactly the beginning and ending of your selected Regions (see the green rectangles in the Range Markers ruler):    Go to menu Session \u0026gt; Export and choose Export to Audio File(s) (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo;).\n  In the Export dialog box, click on the \u0026ldquo;Time span\u0026rdquo; tab. You will see all the newly created Ranges listed there. There is also a default Range that stands for the entire Session.\n  Under \u0026ldquo;Time Span\u0026rdquo;, click \u0026ldquo;Select All\u0026rdquo;, and de-select the very first Range (the \u0026ldquo;session\u0026rdquo; Range). The reason is because we want to export the shorter Ranges, not the whole Session.\n    Go back to the main tab (\u0026quot;File format\u0026quot;).\n  Click \u0026ldquo;Export\u0026rdquo;.\n  You Regions have now been exported to single audio files.\nThis method exports everything that falls under each defined time range. In other words, if you have other regions in other tracks sounding simultaneously with the region(s) you want to export, they will be mixed together. Another way of looking at it is this: the export operation will export everything that plays under the defined time ranges. If that is not what you want, you can use solo or mute buttons on select tracks to ensure you export only what you want.\n Continuing Finally, the next chapter will show discuss Exporting Ranges rather than just an individual Region. The last trick (exporting multiple regions at once) in fact already involved using ranges, as you may have guessed.\nNext: EXPORTING A RANGE\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/appendices/further-help/","title":"Further help","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Besides the URLs listed in the Links chapter, there are a couple of resources on the Internet to help you learn Ardour and fix some of the problems that you might have along the way.\nArdour Manual The official Ardour Manual is the main reference to Ardour.

While you are working on it, you should save it frequently.

The main session file is called \u0026ldquo;my_session.ardour\u0026rdquo;. The Session file is periodically backed up by Ardour with a .bak extension. The .history file keeps a record of changes you have made during your Session, and is also periodically backed up. The interchange folder contains the actual audio data of all the Regions used in your Session. The export folder is where exported files are saved by default.  If double-clicking on the session file does not launch Ardour, use the standard method of first opening the application itself, then choosing a session from the Session Setup dialog.\n Moving a session to another computer or disk If you need to move your Ardour session to another computer, or if you would like to make a backup of it on an external drive, you must copy the entire folder containing all of the files mentioned above. It is not enough to copy just the *.ardour file.\nWhen copying an Ardour folder to another computer or drive, do not manually change its name or the name of any of the internal files.\n Continuing Saving an entire Session allows you to open it again at a later time.

In addition to these core tools, a wide range of Plugin effects can also be used to enhance the sound, such as Reverb and Delay.Â Introducing the Mixer Strip The Mixer Strip is the vertical column that contains various controls related to signal flow. Each Track and Bus in Ardour has its own Mixer Strip. The Mixer Strip is also the main tool we will use in the process of Mixing our Tracks. In this chapter, we will get a general overview of the Mixer Strip, with each section described. We will also provide references to chapters containing information specific to each aspect of the Mixer Strip.\nThe Mixer Strip from Top to Bottom Mixer Strips can be accessed from both the Editor Window and the Mixer Window (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;M\u0026rdquo; to toggle between the two). Mixer Strips in either window (Editor or Mixer) mirror each other: any actions performed on a Mixer Strip in the Mixer Window will be reflected in the corresponding Mixer Strip in the Editor Window, and vice-versa. The Editor Window and Mixer Window are more fully explained in the An Overview of the Interface chapter.Â In the Editor Window, you can see the Mixer Strip of the currently selected track on the left side of the window. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see it, hit \u0026ldquo;Shift\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo; to display the Editor Mixer Strip.\nOverview Here we see the entire Mixer Strip, as it would appear in either the Editor Window or the Mixer Window.\nRegular \u0026amp; Narrow Modes The Mixer Strip can be switched betweenÂ the regular width and a more narrow width to conserve space. The very top part of the Mixer Strip, pictured below, switches between regular and narrow modes using the left button. The right button hides the Mixer Strip entirely.\nTrack Name and Routing Button Continuing from top to bottom, the next section of the Mixer Strip contains three narrow regions. The first of these regions shows the name of the Track (that\u0026rsquo;s the word \u0026ldquo;Audio 1\u0026rdquo; in the image below). The next region, named \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; in the image below, is a button which allows access to the input Routing. Please see the Understanding Routing and Recording Audio chapters for more information on input Routing. The last narrow region controls phase reversing (we won\u0026rsquo;t go into details on this topic in this tutorial).\nProcessor Box The large black region at the bottom of this section is the Processor Box. This is where you can add Plugins, for example. The processor box will always contain a blue Fader processor. This indicates where in the processor chain the main channel fader is located â this is the fader shown in the lower half of the strip. Please see Using Plugins and Using Sends for a detailed discussion of this area.\nThe next portion of the Mixer Strip includes controls for Panning, Record, Mute, and Solo, among others.\nPanning Panning has to do with placement of sounds anywhere between Left and Right speakers. Please refer to the Panning chapter for more information.\nSolo When a Track or Bus is on Solo, all the other Tracks or Busses which are not likewise on Solo will be inaudible through the Master Bus or the Audition. We can also find a miniaturized Solo Button in the Track Mixer. Note that soloing a bus will not silence any tracks and vice-versa.\nWhen any Track or Bus is on Solo, the Solo Indicator in the Auxiliary Controls menu will flash red. Clicking the Solo Indicator while it is flashing will deactivate every Solo in the Session.\nMute Any Track or Bus on Mute will be inaudible through the Master Bus or the Audition. The Track Mixer also contains a miniaturized Mute Button, in between the Record Arm Button and the Solo Button. Right-Clicking on the Mute Button gives you advanced options for the behavior of the mute button.\nArm Record The Rec button arms the track for recording, as seen in the Recording Audio chapter.\nFader, Fade/Peak Meters The most prominent control present in a Mixer Strip is the Fader, used to adjust the overall gain for the corresponding Track or Bus. The Peak Meter shows the Peak Value of the selected track, and is located directly to the right of the Fader. Each Peak Meter consists of one Bar Graph in the case of a Mono Track, and two Bar Graphs in case of a Stereo track. The small rectangular field above the meters shows the highest Peak Value that has been played on that track so far.\nBy clicking the right-hand button at the bottom of the Mixer Strip (it reads \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; in the image above), you will be able to select the Metering Point, for example the direct \u0026ldquo;in\u0026rdquo; from the sound card, the \u0026ldquo;pre\u0026rdquo; Fader signal, or the \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; fader signal.\nAs you can see in the image below, there is a smaller version of the Mixer Strip in each Track, called the Track Mixer, which contains a horizontal Fader, a vertical Peak Meter as well as miniature buttons for Arm Record, Mute, and Solo. They all mirror those found in the Mixer Strip for that Track.\nPlease refer to the chapter on Mixing Levels for more detailed instruction about using the Fader and Peak Meters.\nRouting Finally, we reach the bottom of the Mixer Strip. Here we find the Output Routing Button, marked as \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; in the earlier screenshot, which is discussed in the Understanding Routing chapter.\nContinuing Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve had a look at the main areas of the Mixer Strip, we can proceed to the Mixing Levels chapter to see how we can start to use it.\nNext: MIXING LEVELS\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/exporting-sessions/exporting-a-range/","title":"Exporting a range","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Learn how to export a selected portion (Range) of your Session.\nExporting is the process of saving a Region, Track or Session to a file on your computer. As we learned previously, exporting an isolated Region does not export all of the changes you might have made to that Region. To export edits such as Panning, Fader Automation, and Plugin effects, you must Export either a Range or the entire Session.\nExporting a Range To export a range, follow these steps:\n CLick on the Range Mode button (shortcut \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo;)   Make a Range selection:   Right click on the Range and choose \u0026ldquo;Export Range\u0026rdquo; from the menu:  This will open the familiar Export dialog explained in the Exporting a Session chapter. Choose your options, if any, and click Export. The Range will be exported and saved as an audio file.\nWhat exactly is a Range? To define a Range is simply to specify a beginning and ending point in time. The Selection display to the right of the secondary clock shows the start and end times of the selected range, as well as its duration. The Range created through the method above will disappear as soon as you click outside of it.\nThe Export Range command will export everything that plays through the Master Bus, exactly as it plays back in your Session. If any of the Tracks have the Mute or Solo buttons engaged, this will also affect which Tracks are heard in the Exported file.\nWhat is a Range Marker? Range Markers are essentially two location markers the are grouped together to mark the beginning and end of a section in the timeline. You can user Range Markers to \u0026ldquo;bookmark\u0026rdquo; (so to speak) one or more Ranges that you need to remember or use again later. Range Markers look like this on the timeline:\nThere are a few ways to create Range Markers:\n From a Range selection, right click on it and choose \u0026ldquo;Add Range Marker\u0026rdquo;. From the timeline, right click on the \u0026ldquo;Range Markers\u0026rdquo; horizontal space and choose \u0026ldquo;New Range\u0026rdquo;.

Any volume adjusment left to do? etc.)\nStart and End Markers Finally, make sure the Start and End markers are in the right place.\nEverything included between the Start and End Location Markers in the Timeline will be exported, so you have to set the markers first if they are not in the correct position. In the image below, clearly the End marker is too far to the right in the timeline. This will result in a huge silence after the end of the piece (that is, between the last Region and the End marker).\nIf your End marker is too far after the end of your piece, click and drag it to the left until it is pretty close to the end of the very last Region of your composition.\nExport it! To Export a Session, use the top menu: Session \u0026gt; Export \u0026gt; Export to Audio File(s)\u0026hellip;.

Format: this allows you to choose the file format (WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, etc.). The default is CD (Red Book), which will give you a WAV file. Add another format: if you\u0026rsquo;d like to export in more than one format at the same time, click on this tab. Location: this is the place where you will find the file after it is saved. By default, it is in the \u0026ldquo;export\u0026rdquo; folder that lives inside your main Session folder. You could also click \u0026ldquo;Browse\u0026rdquo; and select the Desktop, for example. Label: THIS is where you can create a unique name for the file. Ardour will automatically append the session name to the exported file, so if you don\u0026rsquo;t write anything here the name may end up something generic like \u0026ldquo;my-session.wav\u0026rdquo;. Use this field to give a unique name to your file.  Having chosen your options, click Export. After the operation is finished, you can find the file using your file browser.\nExport is handled through the Master Bus, so the final file will include all the sounds from Tracks and Busses that were routed to it. This will include any Normalizing, Fading, Panning, and Automation you have created, along with the individual edits made to the Regions as well. If any of the Tracks have the Mute or Solo buttons engaged, this will also affect which Tracks will be heard in the Exported file.\n Advanced Options Click on the tabs \u0026ldquo;Time span\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Channels\u0026rdquo; in case you need to access advanced export options.\nContinuing At the end of this chapter, you now have an Exported Stereo Mix representing your entire Session.

PowerBooks and MacBooks made in 2007 or later will need this set up in order for JACK to have both input and output channels. This is set up in the Audio MIDI Setup application. AIFF A sound file format developed by Apple and commonly used for lossless and uncompressed audio. AIFF files are compatible with Windows, Macintosh and Linux operating systems. ALSA (Linux) Advanced Linux Sound Architecture. ALSA provides audio and MIDI functionality to the Linux operating system. Amplitude (mixing) The strength of an audio signal. The scale of amplitude is logarithmic, since it expresses the physical ratio of power between one sound and another. Levels in digital audio systems are usually represented as the number of Decibels below the clipping point of 0 dB. See also loudness. Arm (Track to record/Ardour to record) Action that makes Ardour ready to start recording. Before recording in Ardour, one or more tracks need to be armed first, and then Ardour needs to be armed itself. Artifacts (sound) Perceivable distortion or decrease in sound quality generated as a by-product of certain signal processing operations. Artefacts are usually seen as undesirable or unexpected results of an otherwise intentional sound transformation. Attenuation Reducing the level of an audio signal, usually measured using a logarithmic scale. See also gain.

Mac OS X comes with a collection of AU plug-ins such as EQ filters, dynamic processors, delay, reverb, time stretch, among others. Audition The auditioner is a hidden mixer strip which auditioned regions are played back through. Auditioning a region will play only that region, without processing sends or plugins. Automation Automation is the automatic adjustment of various parameters such as gain, panning or plugin settings. Changes can be made once and then will be repeated every time the mix is replayed. Automation in Ardour is controlled by automation lines linked to each Track or Bus. Auxiliary Controls Buttons on the top right side of the controls found in the Editor Window: Punch In/Out, Auto Play, Auto Return, Auto Input, Click, Solo, and Audition. Amplitude The level or magnitude of a signal. Audio signals with a higher amplitude usually sound louder. Bands (equalization) The particular frequency regions to be boosted or attenuated in the process of Equalization. Bars (music) Same as \u0026lsquo;measure\u0026rsquo;, a bar is a metrical unit. In Western notation, it is the space comprised between two vertical lines drawn through the staff. The specific duration of a bar depends of its time signature and the current Tempo of the music. Bass (Frequencies) A generic way of referring to the lower frequencies of the Spectrum of a sound. Beat The basic pulse underlying a piece of music. Beats per Minute Beats per minute (BPM) is a measure of Tempo in music. A rate of 60 beats per minute means that one beat will occur every second; 120 bpm equals two beats per second, and so on. BPM indications usually appear at the beginning of a traditional musical score as a metronome mark (for example, \u0026ldquo;quarter note equals 60\u0026rdquo;, meaning one quarter note per second). Bit A bit (binary digit) is a single number with a value of either 0 or 1. Bit Depth Refers to the number of bits used to write a sample. In the CD standard, each sample of audio is represented by a 16-bit number. This gives 2^16 (two to the power of sixteen = 65,536) possible values that a sample can have. A higher bit depth means a greater possible dynamic range. Studio recordings are usually first made recorded with a bit depth of 24 (or even 32) to preserve as much detail before transfer to CD. DVDs are made at 24 bit, while video games from the 1980s remain famous for their distinctively rough \u0026ldquo;8 bit sound\u0026rdquo;. Bit depth is also referred to as word length. Buffer Size (JACK) The buffer is a section of memory specifically allotted to temporary signal data. Small buffer sizes allow a lower latency and so are needed when using audio applications that require real-time interaction. The drawback is that CPU consumption for the system is higher with smaller buffer sizes. Larger buffers (like 512 or 1024) can be used when there is no such requirement. Built-in Input and Output These are the default interfaces for getting sound in and out of your computer if you don\u0026rsquo;t have an external sound card. In a laptop, they are the common input (mic) and output (headphone) connections. Bus A bus is similar to a Track except that it does not contain its own regions. You cannot record directly into a bus or drag regions into it. The Mixer Strip vertically represents the signal flow of a bus, whereas the Main Canvas horizontally displays time-based information for each bus (such as automation lines). BWF Broadcast Wave Format (BWF) is an extension of the popular Microsoft WAVE audio format and is the recording format of most file-based non-linear digital recorders used for motion picture and television production. This file format allows the inclusion of metadata to facilitate the seamless exchange of sound data between different computer platforms and applications. CAF CAF (Core Audio Format) is a file format for storing audio, developed by Apple. It is compatible with Mac OS X 10.4 and higher. The Core Audio Format is designed to overcome limitations of older digital audio formats, including AIFF and WAV. Just like the QuickTime .mov file format, a .caf file format can contain many different audio formats, metadata tracks, and much more data. Center Frequency In some EQ plugins, the user has the possibility of choosing the center frequency for each of the Frequency Bands. The center frequency of a Band will be the one most sharply attenuated or reinforced by the equalizer for that specific band. Frequencies surrounding the center frequency will be less affected. Click (Mouse) In this manual, it specifically means to click on the left button of your mouse. Whenever the right button is required, the action is referred to as \u0026ldquo;right-click\u0026rdquo;. Clipping Clipping occurs when a signal is too high in level to be reproduced. Any samples too high in level will simply be truncated, resulting in distortion, loss of audio detail, and artefact frequencies which were not present in the original sound. Clipping Point The clipping point of a digital system is referred to as 0 dB, and the level of any sound is measured in how far below the clipping point it is (-10 dB, -24 dB, etc). Clocks The two big numerical displays near the top of the Editor Window. They can display the time in a number of formats: Timecode, Bars:Beats, Minutes:Seconds, and Samples. Compile FLOSS applications are distributed as source code, which is human-readable but cannot be run as an actual application. To turn this source code into a running application, it must first be Compiled. When you download a disk image for Mac OS X or a software package from your distribution (such as Ubuntu, Debian or Fedora), it has been compiled for you already. However, if you wish to add features (such as support for VST Plugins) which your distribution does not provide, then you must Compile the application from source code yourself. Compression(DSP) Essentially, compression makes the quiet parts of a signal louder without changing the level of the louder parts. This entails a reduction of the actual dynamic range: a compressed sound is less dynamic (has a smaller range of levels) Compression (data) Like any other data, audio data can be compressed so that it uses less hard disk space. Compression such as FLAC, ALAC, or MLP reduce the size of audio files compared to WAV or AIFF without changing the data, which is referred to as lossless compression. Audio can be compressed to a still smaller size by using lossy compression such as MP3, Ogg Vorbis or AAC but this is achieved by removing data which can have an audible effect. Connections Manager(JACK) The window in Jack that allows to manage all connections between audio inputs and outputs. CoreAudio(Mac OS X) CoreAudio provides audio functionality to the Mac OS X operating system. Cursor Modes These are the six buttons just below the Transport commands in the Editor Window. The six different functions that the mouse pointer can have in Ardour are: Select/Move Objects, Select/Move Ranges, Select Zoom Range, Draw Gain Automation, Stretch/Shrink Regions, Listen to Specific Regions. Decibels Decibel is a logarithmic scale used to measure many quantities, including the gain, level or loudness of a signal. Decibel is usually abbreviated to dB and in digital audio usually denotes how far under 0 dBFS (the clipping point of a system) a signal is. Delay(effect) The amount of time between one event and another. As an audio effect, a delay takes an incoming sound signal and delays it for a certain length of time. When mixed with the original sound, an \u0026ldquo;echo\u0026rdquo; is heard. By using feedback to return the delayed signal back into the delay (usually after lowering its gain), multiple echos with a decay result. Destructive Editing/Recording Destructive actions are those that permanently modify or erase the original data (sound files) in the course of editing or recording. Distortion Distortion occurs when an audio signal is changed in some way that produces frequencies not present in the original. Distortion can be deliberate or unwanted, and can be produced by driving the signal to a clippingpoint, or by using mathematical transformations to alter the shape (or \u0026ldquo;waveform\u0026rdquo;) of the signal (usually referred to as \u0026ldquo;waveshaping\u0026rdquo;). Disk Image (.dmg) A disk image is a single file containing the complete contents and structure representing a data storage medium or device. By double-clicking on a .dmg file on a Mac, a virtual device will be mounted to your Desktop (it will look as if you had inserted a USB device or a DVD, for example). Many software installers in OS X are available as .dmg files. Driver(JACK) Software written to control hardware. CoreAudio is the Mac sound driver. ALSA is the most common Linux driver. DSP Digital Signal Processing. Dynamic Range Used to refer to the difference between the loudest and the quietest sound that can possibly recorded, as well as the amount of detail which can be heard in between those extremes. Sounds which are too quiet to be recorded are said to be below the noise floorof the recording system (microphone, recorder, sound card, audio software, etc). Sounds which are too loud will be distortedor clipped. Edit Modes The three available Edit Modes (Slide Edit, Slice Edit, and Lock Edit) control the behavior of editing operations in the Main Canvas. Edit Point The point in the Main Canvas where an action such as Paste takes place. This can be the Mouse, the Playhead or a Marker. Editor Window Ardour provides two ways of viewing a session: the Editor and the Mixer. The Editor represents the time based aspects of a session: it shows tracks and busses as horizontal timeline displays, with material within the tracks (audio, MIDI, video, automation data, etc.) arranged along the horizontal (time) axis. EQ See Equalization. Equalization Equalization (EQ) is the process of adjusting the relative levels of different frequencies in a recording or signal. In other words, it is the process of boosting or attenuating the various frequency bands of a sound according to a chosen artistic goal. Filter A type of signal processing that supresses some frequencies. Floating Point Numbers It is simply a number with a decimal point. \u0026ldquo;Floating Point\u0026rdquo; refers to the specific technique the computer uses to represent a larger range of integer and non-integer values. FLAC An open source lossless audio format generally compatible with Linux, Windows and Macintosh. Unlike AIFF and WAV, FLAC is a compressed format, allowing file sizes to be reduced. FLOSS FLOSS stands for Free Libre Open Source Software. FLOSS Manuals is a collection of manuals about free and open source software together with the tools used to create them and the community that uses those tools. They include authors, editors, artists, software developers, activists, and many others. Format (audio file) The types of sound file that sounds are saved as. Among the most common are AIFF, WAV, FLAC, mp3 and Ogg Vorbis. fps Frames Per Second. Frame rate, or frame frequency is the frequency (rate) at which an imaging device produces unique consecutive images called frames. The term applies equally well to computer graphics, video cameras, film cameras, and motion capture systems. Frame rate is most often expressed in frames per second (FPS). Frequency Refers to the number of times an oscillation occurs in one second. Frequency is measured in Hertz, and is correlated to the pitch of a sound. Frequency is a linear scale, while pitch is logarithmic. The pitch \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; above the middle C has a frequency of 440 Hz. The \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; one octave above is twice that frequency (880 Hz). Gain Increasing the levelof an audio signal, usually measured using a logarithmic scale. See also attenuation. Grid The Grid is a system of points that a Region might snap to while editing it. The Grid can be \u0026ldquo;No Grid\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Grid\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Magnetic\u0026rdquo;. Grid Points The points in the Grid which Regions will snap to when it is active. Grid Points may be minutes, seconds, video frames, bars, beats or some multiple of beats. Hertz A term used to describe the number of times something occurs in one second. In digital audio, it is used to describe the sampling rate, and in acoustics it is used to describe the frequency of a sound. Thousands of Herz are described as kHz (kilo Herz). High Shelf In an Equalizer, a Shelf cuts or boosts everything above (High Shelf) or below (Low Shelf) a specific frequency. Headroom The range of Decibels between the region\u0026rsquo;s maximum Peakand the Clipping Point is commonly referred to as Headroom. It is common recording practice to keep approximately three to six Decibels of Headroom between the maximum of your signal and the Clipping Point. Jack Audio Connection Kit (JACK) JACK is a low-latency audio system which manages connections between Ardour and the soundcard of your computer, and between Ardour and other JACK-enabled audio programs on your computer. You must install JACK for Linux or JackOSX before you can use Ardour. JackOSX (OS X) The name of the version of JACK that runs on Mac OS X. See JACK for more details. JackPilot The control interface that comes with JackOSX. Jack Server The Jack Server is the \u0026ldquo;engine\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;backend\u0026rdquo; of the Jack Audio Connection Kit. Jack Router The Jack Router allows audio to be routed from one application to another using the Jack Server. JAMin JAMin is the Jack Audio Connection Kit Audio Mastering interface. JAMin is an open source application designed to perform professional audio mastering of stereo input streams. It uses LADSPA for digital signal processing (DSP). LADSPA Plugins Linux Audio Developer Simple Plugin API (LADSPA) is a standard that allows software audio processors and effects to be plugged into a wide range of audio synthesis and recording packages. For instance, it allows a developer to write a reverb program and bundle it into a LADSPA \u0026ldquo;plugin library.\u0026rdquo; Ordinary users can then use this reverb within any LADSPA-friendly audio application. Most major audio applications on Linux support LADSPA. Latency Latency is the amount of time needed to process all the samples coming from sound applications on your computer and send it to the soundcard for playback, or to gather samples from the sound card for recording or processing. A shorter latency means you will hear the results quicker, giving the impression of a more responsive system. However, with a shorter latency you also run a greater risk of glitches in the audio because the computer might not have enough time to process the sound before sending it to the soundcard. A longer latency means fewer glitches, but at the price of a slower response time. Latency is measured in milliseconds. Limiting The process by which the amplitude of the output of a device is prevented from exceeding a predetermined value. Linear A scale of numbers which progresses in an additive fashion, such as by adding one (1, 2, 3, 4\u0026hellip;), two (2, 4, 6, 8\u0026hellip;) or ten (10, 20, 30, 40\u0026hellip;). Multiplying an audio signal, for example, by either a linear or a logarithmic scale will produce very different results. The scale of frequency is linear, while the scales of pitch and gain are logarithmic. Linux kernel The core of the GNU/Linux operating system. In a Real-time System, this kernel is usually Compiledwith new parameters which speed up the use of audio applications in the system. Lock Edit One of the three available Edit Modes, Lock Edit is similar to Slice Edit, but regions will remain at their original positions regardless of any edit operation performed. Logarithmic A scale of numbers which progresses according to a certain ratio, such as exponentially (2, 4, 8, 16, 256\u0026hellip;). Both scales of pitch and gain are logarithmic, while the scale of frequency is linear. Lossless See Compression (data) Lossy See Compression (data) Loudness Unlike amplitude, which expresses the physical power of a sound, loudness is the perceived strength of a sound. Tones at different frequencies may be perceived as being at different loudnesses, even if they are at the same amplitude. LV2 LV2 is an open standard for plugins and matching host applications, mainly targeted at audio processing and generation. LV2 is a simple but extensible successor of LADSPA, intended to address the limitations of LADSPA which many applications have outgrown. Main Canvas In the Editor Window of Ardour, the Main Canvas is the space just below the timeline rulers where Tracks and Busses are displayed horizontally. Master Out A master out is a bus to which all (or most) tracks and other busses send their output. It provides a convenient single point of control for the output of Ardour, and is a typical location for global effects. Master out use is enabled by default, and the master out bus is set up to be stereo. Meter The grouping of strong and weak beats into larger units called bars or measures. Mixing Audio mixing is the process by which a multitude of recorded sounds are combined into one or more channels, most commonly two-channel stereo. In the process, the levels, frequency content, dynamics and panoramic position of the source signals are commonly manipulated and effects such as reverb may be added. MIDI MIDI is an industry-standard protocol defined in^^ 1982 that enables electronic musical instruments such as keyboard controllers, computers and other electronic equipment to communicate, control, and synchronize with each other. MIDI allows computers, synthesizers, MIDI controllers, sound cards, samplers and drum machines to control one another, and to exchange system data. MIDI does not transmit audio signals, but simply messages such as note number (pitch), velocity (intensity), note-on, and note-off. Mixer Strip Each track and bus is represented in the Mixer Window by a vertical Mixer Strip** that contains various controls related to signal flow. There are two places in Ardour in which you can see mixer strips. The mixer window is the obvious one, but you can also view a single mixer strip on the left hand side of the Editor (shift + E to hide/view) Mixer Window The Mixer shows the session by representing tracks vertically as Mixer Strips, with controls for gain, record enable, soloing, plugins etc. The Mixer represents the signal flow of Tracks and Busses in an Ardour session. The mixer window provides a view that mimics a traditional hardware mixing console. Monitoring Monitoring is the process of routing a specific mix or submix of your session into separate outputs (like headphones). For example, a musician being recorded may want to listen to existing material while performing. Ardour and JACK make it easy to setup monitor outs since any incoming signal can then be delivered back to any output, optionally mixed together with other signals and with any kind of sound processing added. Mono A mono sound file contains only one channel of audio. A mono track in Ardour has only one input and handles mono sound files. MP3 A lossy, size-compressed sound file Format. Graphic Equalizer/Multi-Band Equalizer A Graphic (or Multi-Band) Equalizer consists of a bank of sliders for boosting or attenuating different frequency of a sound. Non-destructive Editing/Recording This is a form of editing where the original content is not modified in the course of editing. Behind the scenes, the original sound file is kept intact, and your edits are in fact a list of instructions that Ardour will use in order to reconstruct the signal from the original source when you play it back. For example, creating fade-ins and fade-outs on your Regions is a type of non-destructive editing. Normalize To normalize an audio signal means to adjust its Gain so that it peaks at the maximum the sound card allows before Clipping. Normal Mode See Track Mode. Note value The proportional duration of a note or rest in relation to a standard unit. For instance, a \u0026lsquo;quarter note\u0026rsquo; (crotchet) is so-called because its relative duration is one quarter of a whole note (semibreve). Octave (music) A distance of 12 semitones between two notes. In Hertz, the ratio of an octave is 2:1. For example, the note \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; above the middle C has a frequency of 440 Hz. The note \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; one octave above is 880 Hz, and one octave below is 220 Hz. Ogg Vorbis An open source lossy, size-compressed sound file format. Panning Panning is the location of sounds in the Stereo Field. Parametric Equalizer The Parametric Equalizer is the most versatile type ofEQ used for Mixing because of its extensive control over all the parameters of filtering. Peaks Peaks are a graphical representation of the maximum Levels of a Region. Peak Meters Peak Meters are a running representation of the maximum Levels of a Region, and are located next to the Fader in the Mixer Window, and also in the Track Mixer, of each Track. Pitch Pitch represents the perceived fundamental frequency of a sound.^^^^It is one of the three major auditory attributes of sounds along with loudness and timbre. In MIDI, pitch is represented by a number between 0 and 127, with each number representing a key on a MIDI keyboard. The relation of pitch to Frequency is Logarithmic. This means that a sound which is heard as one Octave(+12 MIDI notes) above another one is twice the frequency in Hz, while a sound one octave below (-12 MIDI notes) is half the frequency. Playhead In Ardour, the Playhead is the red line that moves in time (i.e., left to right) to indicate the current playback position. Plugin In computing, a plugin consists of a computer program that interacts with a host application (in this case, Ardour) to provide a certain function \u0026ldquo;on demand\u0026rdquo;, usually a very specific one. Reverb, filters, and equalizers are examples of plugins that can be used in Ardour in association with Tracks or Busses. Portaudio A free and open source set of audio driversfor Linux and Mac OS X. Post-Fader (Plugin or Send) In the Mixer Strip, the post-fader area is the black space below the gain slider, to which plugins or sends can be added. The input of these plugins and sends will be the signal after any manual or automated gain change (thus \u0026ldquo;post-fader\u0026rdquo;). Pre-Fader (Plugin or Send) In the Mixer Strip, the pre-fader area is the black space above the gain slider, to which plugins or sends can be added. The input of these plugins and sends will be the incoming signal before it is affected by any manual or automated gain changes controlled by the slider (thus \u0026ldquo;pre-fader\u0026rdquo;). Quantization In signal processing, quantization may refer to bit depth (see bit depth definition). In MIDI, quantization refers to the process of aligning notes to a precise temporal grid. This results in notes being set on beats or exact fractions of beats. MIDI sequencers typically include some type of quantization function. Range A segment of time. Ranges are created with the Select/Move Ranges tool and may include one or more tracks. Loop and punch ranges are special types of ranges that are created and manipulated with the loop/punch ranges meter. Real-time System(Linux) In a Real-time System, the Linux kernel is usually recompiled (rebuilt) with new parameters, and other settings in the system are optimized which speed up the use of audio applications in the system. Regions Regions are the basic elements of editing and composing in Ardour. Each region represents all or part of an audio file. Removing a region from a track does not remove the audio file from the disk. Region List The region list is located at the right hand side of the Editor Window and it shows all the regions associated with the session. Reverberation Reverberation is the persistence of sound in a particular space after the original sound source is removed.^^^^A reverberation, or reverb, is created when a sound is produced in an enclosed space causing a large number of echoes to build up and then slowly decay as the sound is absorbed by the walls and air. Digital reverberation can be added to a sound in Ardour through the use of plugins. Right Click (mouse) Click on the right button of your mouse. Routing Routing is sending an audio signal from somewhere to somewhere else. Signals can be routed not only from the outside world into Ardour and vice-versa, but also within Ardour itself (for example, from a Track to a Bus). Rulers Rulers are the thin horizontal bars that display the time line, helping to see when exactly a region or sound starts or stops. Also displayed with the rulers are the meter and tempo markers, the location markers, the range markers and the loop/punch ranges. Sample (data) In digital audio, a sample is the smallest possible segment of a recorded sound. In CD audio, for example, it takes 44,100 samples to make one second of recorded sound, and so we can say that the sampling rate is 44,100 Hertz. Samples also have a bit depth which determines the dynamic range that is possible to record and playback. Common bit depths are 16 (for CD audio), 24 (for studio recording and DVDs) or 32 (for sounds inside the computer). Sample (music) In electronic music, the word sample can mean any portion of sound extracted from an existing piece of music to be reused in a new composition. Sampler An electronic music instrument or software which plays back a recorded sound (or sample) whenever it is sent a note message. The pitch of the note determines how fast or slow the sample is played back, which emulates the pitch changes in other instruments. Samples can be looped (played over and over) and one-shot (played once). Sampling Rate The rate at which the computer records and plays back sound, which is measured in Hertzrepresenting the number of samplesper second. CD audio is recorded and played at 44,100 Hz (or 44.1 kHz), while DVD audio runs at 96,000 Hz (96 kHz) and cheap consumer gadgets like voice recorders, video games, mobile phones, toys and some MP3 players often use a rate of 22,050 Hz (22.05 kHz) or even less. The sampling rate determines the highest frequency that can be recorded or played, which is expressed by the Nyquist number (half the sampling rate). Playing back sounds at a different sampling rate then they were recorded at will result in hearing that sound at the \u0026ldquo;wrong speed\u0026rdquo;. Send An optional auxiliary output for a track or bus. Session A session is all of the information that constitutes one project in Ardour. Each session is saved in its own folder containing all the audio, region and parametric data, and a master file with the .ardour extension. Shelf In an Equalizer, a Shelf cuts or boosts everything above (High Shelf) or below (Low Shelf) a specific frequency. Slice Edit One of the three available Edit Modes, Slice Edit does not allow dragging regions around, but still allows you to perform slice operations (such as cut, paste, and split). Space between regions will be kept constant after any edit operation that affects it. If you delete the second half of a region, for example, any subsequent regions on the same track will automatically move back in the time grid. Slide Edit Another one of the three available Edit Modes, Slide Edit is the default mode. It allows you to drag regions around horizontally (within the same track) and vertically (between tracks). SMPTE timecode : A set of cooperating standards to label individual frames of video or film with a timecode defined by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. Timecodes are added to film, video or audio material, and have also been adapted to synchronize music. They provide a time reference for editing, synchronization and identification. Snap Mode The Snap Mode menus are found just below the Clocks. They control the amount Quantization of the time grid, i.e., the amount of \u0026ldquo;snap\u0026rdquo; an audio Region has to the type of grid you have chosen. Snapshots Saving a snapshot in Ardour is similar to saving the session to a new file to avoid overwriting the original session file. A snapshot contains the current state of your work, while sharing all the audio and data files of the Session. If you were trying to find a \u0026ldquo;Save As\u0026rdquo; function in Ardour, saving a snapshot is probably what you are looking for. Solo Toggle switch found in track controls and mixer strips. When toggled on, only solo tracks will send output. Several tracks can be marked solo at once. The general Solo button (top row of controls in the Editor Window) can be used to un-solo all soloed tracks at once. Spectrum The representation of a signal in terms of its frequency components. Stereo A stereo sound file contains two channels of audio (usually known as Left and Right channels). A stereo track in Ardour has two inputs and outputs, in order to record and playback stereo files. Stereo Field Stereo field is the perception of spatial location of sounds based on a sound reproduction system of 2 channels (Left and Right). Take(recording) A sequence of sound recorded continuously at one time. Tape Mode See Track Mode. Tempo(music) The rate at which beats occur. Precise Tempo indications are measured in bpm (beats per minute), although subjective indications are also common in scores (Allegro, Adagio, Very Fast, etc). Terminal A \u0026ldquo;terminal\u0026rdquo; is the text-based interface that allows to operate a computer by typing commands into it. Most computer users today rely solely on a graphical interface to control their systems. Both Mac OS X and Linux though, include a terminal which may make some tasks easier for some users. Timecode A time code is a sequence of numeric codes generated at regular intervals by a timing system. The SMPTE family of timecodes is almost universally used in film, video and audio production. Time Signature (music) A sign placed at the start of a piece of music (after the clef and key signature) or during the course of it, indicating the meter of the music. Track A Track is the place to where you can drag a Region from your Region Listand where you can record sounds coming from an outside source. The Mixer Strip vertically represents the signal flow of a track, whereas the Main Canvas horizontally displays time-based information for each track. Track Mode Track Mode gives you a choice between Normal Mode and Tape Mode. Normal Mode creates a new Region for each Recording Take, while Tape Mode destructively records\u0026ndash;in other words the previous Take of a Track is eliminated with each new Take. Transport The buttons located on the upper left corner of the Editor Window, with controls such as Rewind, Play, Stop. Treble(frequencies) Generic way of referring to high frequencies of the Spectrum of a sound. VST (Virtual Studio Technology) Steinberg VST is an interface for integrating software audio synthesizer and effect plugins with audio editors and digital workstations such as Ardour. VST and similar technologies use digital signal processing to simulate traditional recording studio hardware with software. Thousands of plugins exist, both commercial and freeware. VST was created by Steinberg. WAV A sound file format developed by Microsoft and IBM and commonly used for lossless and uncompressed audio. WAV files are compatible with Windows, Macintosh and Linux operating systems. Waveform The time-domain visual representation of a sound. Waveforms are drawn inside the colored rectangles representing Regions in the Main Canvas. Word length See Bit Depth.  Appendices: FURTHER HELP || LINKS || CREDITS\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/mixing-levels/","title":"Mixing levels","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Levels are the volumes of each Track relative to the others.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t hear a bass line above the other instruments, the obvious choice would be to raise the bass line volume. Levels can be adjusted using the Fader in the Mixer Strip or in each Track, just below the Track name. The first step in Mixing is to listen to everything that has been recorded and adjust the levels of all Tracks so you can hear everything clearly, but in a manner that is appropriate for the song. For example, the vocal track is normally louder than the rhythm guitar because the voice is the focal point of the song.\nUsing the Fader The Fader is the primary control of Levels for each Track. The exact value of the Track\u0026rsquo;s Levels are displayed in the small rectangular field above the Fader. You can change the Levels by either dragging the slider or typing in a new number directly into the rectangle with the number. By default the Fader is set to â0.0 dB, meaning that the Levels of the Track are not changed. In the screenshot below, the Fader for the track named \u0026ldquo;kick\u0026rdquo; is set to -0.0, and the Peak Meter indicates that the highest peak so far was -5.1.\nAvoiding Clipping One other important task in Mixing is to avoid Clipping.Â The Peak Value on the Mixer Strip turns red when the signal has peaked above 0.0dB. You can use this tool to monitor the highest Levels of your Track while Mixing.\nIn the screenshot below, the synth track has just clipped to +5.9. You can also see little red edges on the waveform itself, indicating the exact locations where the recorded sound clipped.\nClick on the red number in the Peak Meter to reset it.\nFor the sake of the exercise, try to record your voice so that it clips. Hear how the playback is distorted.\n You should make sure that anything that you send to your sound card or that you will eventually Export as a sound file (such as for CD mastering) never goes above 0.0dB to avoid actual Clipping.\nIf the clipping occurs in a very percussive sound and it is almost unnoticeable, you may be able to hide it by decreasing the gain (for example, Normalize the region to 0.0, or a lower number like -1.0). However, often the clipping results in audible distortion of the recorded sound. The best solution in this case is to just record again with lower levels.\nContinuing When you are finished with this chapter of the tutorial, you should have a collection of Tracks whose Levels are well adjusted to each other and do not Clip when added together in the Master Bus. Once this is accomplished, we can proceed to learn about Panning in the next chapter, so that our Mix takes on a strong feeling of Stereo space.\nNext: PANNING\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/saving-sessions/saving-a-snapshot/","title":"Saving a snapshot","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Saving a Snapshot in Ardour is similar to saving your Session to a new file, however using a Snapshot avoids overwriting the original Session file.

From the menu, you can also choose whether to save a snapshot and keep working on the present version, or save a snapshot and switch immediately to that snapshot.\nRecalling Snapshots You can recall a saved Snapshot via the \u0026lsquo;Snapshots\u0026rsquo; tab in the area on the right:\nThere you see a few Snapshots that we created, and the \u0026lsquo;my_session\u0026rsquo; entry represents the original state of our session.\nClick on any Snapshot from the list to reload it.\nContinuing Sometimes it is helpful to have a default starting point for new Sessions, for example for a set-up that you use all the time when starting a new project. To learn how to do this, please continue to the next session called Saving a Template.\nNext: SAVING A TEMPLATE\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/setting-up-the-meter/","title":"Setting up the meter","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The Meter determines the musical speed of the passage we are composing, as measured in Beats Per Minute.\nIf we are composing something rhythmic, it will also determine the lengths of the sound samples we use to some extent.

Video producers will find a frames-per-second Timecode handy, while those wishing for extreme precision may even want to use Samples. All of these can be viewed in Ardour and used as a means to organize your regions and edits.\nPrimary and Secondary Clocks There are two clocks near the top of the Editor Window which can display the time in a number of formats: Timecode, Bars:Beats, Minutes:Seconds and Samples. Right-click to change the format of each of the two clocks.\nThese are called the transport clocks. The left one is the primary transport clock and the right one is the secondary transport clock. The advantage of having two transport clocks is that you see the playhead position in two different time units without having to change any settings.\nTo the right of these two clocks you see the \u0026ldquo;mini-timeline\u0026rdquo;, also called \u0026ldquo;navigation timeline\u0026rdquo;. Check the Ardour Manual for more informaion on clocks and the mini-timeline.\nSnap Modes The Snap Mode menus are found just below the Clocks to the right. They control the amount Quantization of the time grid, i.e., the amount of \u0026ldquo;snap\u0026rdquo; an audio Region has to the type of grid you have chosen.\nWhen No Grid is selected, Regions may be moved freely around within the Tracks. When Grid is selected, Regions will \u0026ldquo;snap\u0026rdquo; to the nearest Grid Point. When Magnetic is selected, Regions can be moved freely but will \u0026ldquo;snap\u0026rdquo; to a Grid Point when they are moved very close to one.\nThe middle Units menu is used to select what the Grid Points will be, such as Beats, Bars, Marks, Minutes, Seconds, various aspects of the SMPTE Timecode, or the edges of Regions.Â Timeline The Timeline is located below the Snap Mode menus, just above the Main Canvas. By Right-Clicking on the Timeline labels (i.e., right-click on the left-side area where the words \u0026ldquo;Timecode, Bar:Beats, Meter\u0026rdquo; etc are displayed), you can set the check boxes to show or hide the different types of time information.\nMinutes/Seconds To view Minutes and Seconds on the Timeline, right-click the Timeline labels and select Mins:Secs.\nBars/Beats To view Bars and Beats on the Timeline, right-click the Timeline and select Bars \u0026amp; Beats.\nIt is possible to set a Meter and Tempo for the entire Ardour session, as well as to change them at different points in the same session. For more information on this, please see the Setting Up the Meter chapter.\nTimecode To work with SMPTE video Timecode, first you need to set the Timecode fps (Frames per Second).

An Audio Track is a place where you can drag a Region from your Region List and where you can record sounds coming from an outside source.\nA Region represents an audio clip, i.e., one of your sound files or just a portion of a sound file. In the image below, the horizontal strip areas marked \u0026ldquo;MyTrack\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;short-drone-mono\u0026rdquo; are Tracks. The rectangles containing audio information are called Regions (for example, the Region \u0026ldquo;wheels-mono.1\u0026rdquo; is contained within MyTrack).\nWhat is a Bus? A Bus is similar to a track except that it does not contain its own regions. You cannot record directly into a bus or drag regions into it. The area marked \u0026ldquo;Master\u0026rdquo; in your session is an example of a Bus. Typically every session has a Master Bus. All the audio to be ExportedÂ from your Session will be sent to the Master Bus.\nHow are Tracks and Busses Used? Audio-processing Plugins and Automation can be applied to both Tracks and Busses.\nAudio tracks can be routed to Busses. In fact, many Tracks can be simultaneously routed to one Bus. Busses are traditionally used as a convenient way to apply any kind of signal processing to many Tracks at once. For instance, you might find it useful to route all Tracks that contain drum sounds to a single Bus that you would call \u0026lsquo;drum bus\u0026rsquo;. Then, if you decide that all your drum Tracks are too loud, you can quickly adjust the level of the \u0026lsquo;drum bus\u0026rsquo; rather than adjusting each separate Track that feeds into it.\nAnother use of a Bus would be to have a common Reverberation Plugin, so that any audio Track which requires the Reverb effect could be routed to a single Bus.\nAdding Tracks and Busses Right-Click in the empty area beneath any existing Tracks and Busses. Alternatively, click on the menu Track \u0026gt; Add Track, Bus, or VCA\u0026hellip; (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Ctrl\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;Shift\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;N\u0026rdquo;). The following window will appear:\nAdd lets you specify how many Tracks (or Busses) you would to like to create.\nChoose Audio Tracks or Audio Busses to specify whether you want to create Tracks or Busses. There are also other options such as MIDI Track and more. Ardour offers different track types depending on the type of data they contain. This tutorial will only cover Audio Tracks and Busses. (see the Ardour Manual for details on all track types)\nYou can optionally give a Name to the Track or Bus being created. The Configuration drop-down menu allows you to specify how many channels of audio you\u0026rsquo;d like the new Track or Bus to handle. For example, if you will be recording your voice on this track using a single microphone, choose Mono. If you plan to import a clip from an existing song and place it on this Track, choose Stereo. The choice made here will also affect which Plugins you can use on the track (Mono tracks cannot use Stereo Plugins and vice versa).\nThe Position menu lets you choose where you want the new track or bus to be placed: first, last, before or after the selection.\nYou can safely ignore the other options for now. To learn more about each of them, please check this page of the complete Ardour Manual.\nClick the Add and Close button to create the Tracks or Busses you have just configured, and automatically close the Add Track window. The tracks you just created will appear as new rows in the Main Canvas. If you still wanted to add more tracks after this step, you could alternatively have chosen Add selected items (and leave dialog open) instead.\nContinuing Once you\u0026rsquo;ve added one or more Tracks, you will want to put some audio material into them to work with.

Later chapters will give more detailed information on each feature listed here.\nThe Editor Window When you create a new session, Ardour opens an empty new window called the Editor Window. The Editor Window is the most important window in Ardour, as this is how you will control the program as well as see and edit the audio you have recorded or imported.\nAt the top of the Editor Window are several main areas: the Transport Menu, the Clocks, the Edit Modes/Cursor Modes menu, the Snap Mode menu and the Auxiliary Controls. Below that area is the Main Canvas, which contains the Tracks and Busses used in the Session. The Mixer Strips for the Tracks appear on the left, and a set of tabs allowing for an overview of the Regions, Tracks/Busses, Snapshots, Edit Groups and Chunks appear on the right. The very bottom of the window is the Summary view, which is a miniature timeline view allowing for quick navigation through the session.\nWe will introduce these controls briefly here and cover them more extensively in dedicated chapters later on.\nTransport Menu The Transport Menu controls include the following buttons:\n MIDI Panic Enable/Disable audio click (metronome) Rewind Fast forward Loop playback Play range/selection Play from playhead Stop Record-enableÂ  Jog/shuttle controls  Clocks The main Clocks are located next to the transport controls. Clocks in Ardour can display time in 4 different formats: Time Code, Bars:Beats, Minutes:Seconds, and Samples. Right-click on the clock to select a format. You can also turn the clock off. The reason for having two transport clocks is that it allows you to see the playhead position in two different time units without having to change any settings.\nPlease see the Setting Up the Timeline chapter for more details on the Clocks.\nEdit Modes and Cursor Modes The Edit Modes and Cursor Modes controls define the behavior of the main canvas and the different functions the cursor can have. There are three Edit Modes in the drop-down menu: Slide, Ripple, and Lock. To the right of the Smart button are the Cursor Modes:\n Smart Mode (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Y\u0026rdquo;) Grab Mode (shortcut \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo;) Range Mode (shortcut \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo;) Cut Mode (shortcut \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo;) Stretch Mode (shortcut \u0026ldquo;T\u0026rdquo;) Audition Mode Draw Mode (shortcut \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo;) Internal Edit Mode (shortcut \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo;)  Most of them are discussed in the Working With Regions chapter. The last two are discussed in the Using Automation chapter.\nThe Smart Mode is actually a combination of Grab Mode and Range Mode. When enabled, the mouse behaves as if it is in \u0026ldquo;Range Mode\u0026rdquo; in the upper half of a region, and in \u0026ldquo;Grab Mode\u0026rdquo; in the lower half.\nSnap Options The Snap Options menu controls the Grid, Grid Points and Edit Point. Please see the chapters on Setting Up the Meter, Using Ranges and Working With Regions for more details.\nZoom Options In between Cursor Modes and Snap Options are the Zoom Options. Here you can define the behavior of zooming operations. You have standard Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons, plus a third called Zoom to Session (useful for having a quick overview of your entire session: it zooms it to fit the available space on the screen).\nUse the shortcuts = (the equal sign on your main keyboard) for zooming, and - (the dash key on your main keyboard) for zooming out.\n The drop-down menu controls the Zoom Focus. It defines the focus point of zooming operations. Try zooming in and out with a different Zoom Focus each time. For example, choosing Playhead will cause zoom to behave in relation to the position of the Playhead. Mouse will take your current mouse position as the reference, and so on.\nThe following drop-down menu and the last two buttons control \u0026ldquo;vertical zoom.\u0026rdquo; They allow you to expand and shrink all tracks and busses vertically. Use the drop-down menu to choose a specific number of tracks you want to fit on the screen. Use the buttons to shrink or expand all tracks (or only selected tracks, if a selection is made).\nAuxiliary Controls For further information on other buttons and displays on the main interface, please refer to the Ardour Manual.\nMain Canvas The main canvas is just below the top rows of controls described above. It basically comprises the Rulers, the space where Tracks and Busses are displayed, and a Summary view at the bottom.\nAt the very top of Ardour\u0026rsquo;s Editor Window (to the right) you will find useful information such as sample rate of the session, available recording time, and DSP use.\nRulers Right-click on the names of rulers and you will see a menu with all the possible rulers at your disposition. You may uncheck rulers that you don\u0026rsquo;t need in order to save screen space. More information on these operations can be found in the Setting up the Timeline and Setting up the Meter chapters.\nTracks and Busses Just below the Rulers is where Tracks and Busses are displayed. In the example below, you can see one Bus called \u0026ldquo;Master\u0026rdquo; and one Track called \u0026ldquo;MyTrack\u0026rdquo;. MyTrack also contains one region, which represents an audio file with a drawing of its waveform. More information on Tracks and Busses can be found in the Creating a Track or Bus chapter.\nEditor Mixer The Editor Mixer is located at the left of the Edit Window. It displays the Mixer Strip of the currently selected Track or Bus. It controls the volume, Plugins and Routing for the Track or Bus to which it corresponds. You can toggle to view or hide the Editor Mixer by clicking on the menu View \u0026gt; Show Editor Mixer (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Shift\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo;). This Mixer is covered in the Using the Mixer Strip chapter.\nRegions, Tracks/Busses, Snapshots, Groups, Ranges, Marks The space on the right of Ardour\u0026rsquo;s Editor Window can have 5 different functions, depending on which tab is currently selected: Regions, Tracks/Busses, Snapshots, Track \u0026amp; Bus Groups, and Ranges and Marks. Regions is the tab selected by default. This part of the Editor Window is commonly referred to as Regions List. Regions represent audio files stored on the hard drive which can be dragged from the Regions List directly onto a track in the main canvas. More information on Regions can be found in the Working With Regions chapter. The Tracks tab is covered in the Arranging Tracks chapter, and Snapshots are discussed in the Saving Snapshots chapter.\nMixer Window Controls The second window, the Mixer Window, can be viewed by going to the main menu and clicking Window \u0026gt; Mixer.\nThe main function of the Mixer Window is to display all the Mixer Strips for the various Tracks side by side for easy reference. This window is mainly used during the Mixing process, and it also provides access Plugins and other Routing features. See the chapters on Understanding Routing, Mixing and Using Plugins for details.\nThis window also contains a listing of the available Mixer Strips in the upper left hand corner. The check boxes in this area can be used to view and hide the Mixer Strips of the different Tracks. Finally, there is an area for managing Groups.\nSwitching Between Windows You can use the key combination Alt + M (Control + M on a Mac) in order to toggle which window is on top: Editor or Mixer.\nContinuing The next chapter will explain how to start a fresh new project.\nNext: Starting a session\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/panning/","title":"Panning","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Panning helps to establish a Stereo Field, a relative space between the speakers in which to place your sounds and instruments.\nOnce you have established a good balance of levels on all the Tracks, you can begin to think about panning.\nThe Panning Interface The Panning control in Ardour is located in the middle of the mixer strip.\nA Mono Track will have a Mono Panner. It looks like this:\nA Stereo Track will have a Stereo Panner, like this:\nMono Panner The default Mono Panner distributes 1 input to 2 outputs. Its behaviour is controlled by a single parameter, the position. By default, the panner is centered. You can change the position by clicking and dragging directly on the Mono Panner. Right-click on the panner to access other options.\nStereo Panner The default Stereo Panner distributes 2 inputs to 2 outputs. Its behaviour is controlled by two parameters, width and position. By default, the panner is centered at full width.\nClick and drag either the Left or the Right button to change the width. For example, if you bring them closer together it will look like this:\nWith a narrower width, you can also drag the top handle to change the relative center position, like this:\nIf we make the Left and Right buttons to overlap completely (that is, width is reduced to zero), the handles turn into a single signal indicator marked \u0026ldquo;M\u0026rdquo; (for mono):\nPanning Tricks A more extensive discussion of panning philosophy and techniques is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but here are some general rules of thumb:\n Guitars tend to be Panned to the left and right. Vocals and bass tend to placed in the center. You want to create a balance so that one side is not louder then the other. Headphones may be helpful in determining how instruments should be panned, and whether the mix feels lopsided because one side is too loud.  Two other tools that are useful in creating a \u0026ldquo;spatial\u0026rdquo; or Stereo Field are Reverb and Delay. These effects can be used together with sends to create a drum send which would be further back in the mix with more Reverb, and a vocal send which might have a little more Delay but sound closer than the drums. Please see the chapter on Using Plugins and Using Sends for more information.\nAlways keep an eye on your Levels while Panning Tracks! Panning a Track to one channel increases the Level of that channel. This may change the balance of Levels you set up in the previous chapter, and in extreme cases can result in Clipping. When this happens, reduce the overall Levels of that Track and check again how it sits in the Mix.\n Continuing By now, you should have a collection of Tracks which are both Mixed well and have an exciting Stereo Image. In the following chapters, we will learn about Using Plugins to enhance the sound of your Mix.\nNext: USING PLUGINS\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/saving-sessions/saving-a-template/","title":"Saving a template","tags":[],"description":"","content":"If you often go through the motions of setting up the same information in each new Session you create, such as the number of input and output Channels, the number and names of Tracks or Busses, or the Routing, then you may wish to create a Template of that information instead.\nWith a Template, you can save the state of a currently open Session without all the Region information files.

Selecting the \u0026ldquo;Grid\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Region bounds\u0026rdquo; items for Grid and Grid Point menus respectively makes this easy.\nTo make a Range selection, drag anywhere on the Timeline. The current Grid and Grid Point options determine exactly how the Range selection behaves. Once a Range has been selected, Right-Clicking on it opens a menu with Range-specific operations.\nLoop range, for example, sets up Loop Markers around the current Range and begins looped playback. The Loop Start and Loop End points can be changed by moving the green triangles which correspond to each point.\nOther useful options here for editing allow you to Duplicate the Range, Select All within the Range or Crop the Range.\nSetting Up a Loop Returning to our rhythmic passage example, we will want to hear the passage we are composing, perhaps as a loop, while we are moving the samples around. To do that, we must create a Range to listen to within our session, so that we can return to exactly this point in the Session again and again.\nZoom out if needed (shortcut \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo;) to see full bars in the timeline.

Beforing using it to record and edit sound, it might be useful to review how digital audio works.\nThe diagram above shows how sound travels to and from your computer. The \u0026ldquo;Analogue to Digital Conversion\u0026rdquo; (ADC) and the \u0026ldquo;Digital to Analogue Conversion\u0026rdquo; (DAC) are done by the sound card or audio interface. The digital system in this case is your computer running Ardour.\nFrequency and Gain Imagine a loudspeaker. To move the air in front of it and make sound, the membrane of the speaker must vibrate from its center position (at rest) backwards and forwards.\nThe number of times the membrane vibrates each second determines the frequency (the note, or pitch) of the sound you hear. The distance the membrane travels from its resting point determines the amplitude (the volume, or loudness) of the sound. Normally, we measure frequency in Hertz (Hz) and amplitude in decibels (dB).\nCheck out the great animation on this page illustrating this process:\n  A microphone works like a loudspeaker in reverse: vibrations in the air cause its membrane to vibrate. The microphone turns these acoustic vibrations into an electrical current. If you plug this microphone into a computer\u0026rsquo;s sound card and start recording, the sound card makes thousands of measurements of this electric current per second and records them as numbers. The number of samples (i.e. measurements) made per second is called the sample rate, and the number of possible values each sample can have is called the bit depth. The combination of sample rate and bit depth indicates how closely the digital signal can reproduce the sound it has recorded.\nPeaks and Clipping When Ardour displays the samples which have been recorded, they appear as the waveform we see below. The center horizontal line indicates the membrane of the speaker at rest, and the peaks of the waveform indicate the maximum amplitude.\nIf we take a waveform and increase its amplitude a lot, some of the peaks may now fall outside the range that the computer can represent digitally. The computer\u0026rsquo;s inability to represent peaks outside the range of amplitude is called clipping, which results in a permanent loss of digital information, as well as a change in the sound quality which is recognizable as distortion. Ardour marks clipped peaks with the color red, as can be seen in the image below.\nIn the image above, one can also see the mixer strip on the far left, which gives a running measurement of the peaks, as well as an indication at the top of the peak meters showing the maximum peak so far. The red number indicates clipping has occurred.\nClipping often can happen at the time of recording if you set your microphone levels too high.\n The range of decibels between the region\u0026rsquo;s maximum peak and the clipping point is commonly referred to as headroom, and common recording practice is to keep approximately 3 to 6 decibels of headroom between the maximum of your signal and the clipping point, with the clipping point itself being represented as 0 dB (zero decibels). In other words, an audio region with a comfortable amount of Headroom would have its maximum peaks between â6 dB and â3 dB.\nAlso, because the peaks of audio signals add together, care must be taken when mixing several sources together to keep the combined signals from clipping.\nSample Rate and Bit Depth To make audio playable on a compact disc, for example, the computer must generate 44,100 samples per second. The sample rate determines the highest frequency which can be recorded or played back by the computer. A sampling rate of 44.1 kHz means that the highest frequency which can be represented is just under 22.05 kHz. Since normal human hearing lies within the range of approximately 20 Hz to 20 kHz, this is commonly accepted as a reasonable sample rate. Other commonly used sample rates include 48 kHz (e.g. multi-effects pedals) or 96 kHz (DVD audio).\nEach sample is recorded as a 16-bit number. One bit is a piece of information which is either 0 or 1. If there are 16 bits together to make one sample, then there are 2^16 (65,536) possible values for each sample.\nThus, we can say that CD-quality audio has a sample rate of 44.1 kHz and a bit depth of 16 bits. Professional music recordings are usually mixed using 24 bits to preserve the highest amount of detail before being mixed down to 16 bits for CD. Older computer games have a distinctively rough sound, using only 8 bits. By increasing the sample rate, we are able to record higher sonic frequencies, and by increasing the bit depth, we are able to use a greater dynamic range (the difference between the quietest and the loudest sounds possible to record and play).\nHere is a great video tutorial explaining sampling rate and bit depth in a lot more detail:\n  "},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/appendices/credits/","title":"Credits","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The main body of the manual was written during a Book Sprint led by Derek Holzer in the moddr_lab at WORM in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, between 23 and 27 November 2009, with input and support from the international community of Ardour users and developers.

A Region can be an entire sound file or a portion of it. Here you will learn how to import audio files from the hard drive of your computer so they can be used in your Ardour session.\nTo import an audio file into your session, you will use the Add existing media dialog. Use the shortcut Ctrl+I to get to this window, or alternatively go to the Session \u0026gt; Import menu).\nOn the left side of this dialog you will see a file browser which allows you to search your hard drive for appropriate sound files to add (preferably, start with a common file format, such as WAV or AIFF).\nAt the lower left corner there is a menu which indicates how these files will be added. \u0026ldquo;Add files as new tracks\u0026rdquo; will import audio files and place them on a newly created track. \u0026ldquo;Add files to region list\u0026rdquo; will simply import audio files into the Region List, without creating any new tracks. Choose this option now, as we don\u0026rsquo;t want Ardour to create any tracks at this point.\nIf you do not have any suitable audio files on your hard drive to follow these steps, visit freesound.org), where you can find a large collection of Public Domain and Creative Commonsâlicensed samples in a variety of sample rates and formats.\n On the right side of the Add existing media dialog you will see a section allowing you to inspect the properties of the file you selected. Here you will see the name, number of channels, sample rate, format and length of the sound file, along with any tags you have chosen to add to the file.\nThe Play button allows you to preview the file. You can also select Auto-play if you would like to hear a sound file immediately as soon as you click on it in the file browser (without having to push the Play button).\nYou will notice that the option Copy Files to Session is checked by default. This will make a copy of the imported file(s) into the folder of the current session. This is safer, but it uses more disk space. If you uncheck this option (not recommended!), Ardour will use the sound file from its current location on the hard drive. In this case, if the file is moved to a new location on the hard drive, you will run into trouble, because Ardour won\u0026rsquo;t be able to find it the next time you open this session. It is highly recommend that you leave this box checked (\u0026ldquo;Copy files to session\u0026rdquo;).\nClick OK to proceed.\nThe file(s) you have imported will appear listed in your Region List. The Region List is located at the far right of the editor window. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see it, make sure \u0026ldquo;Show Editor List\u0026rdquo; is checked under the \u0026ldquo;View\u0026rdquo; menu.\n An alternative method to access the Add Existing Media window is actually to Right-Click directly on the Editor List box. Make sure the Regions tab is selected. Right-Click on an empty part of the Editor List, then choose Import to Region List to open the same Add Existing Media dialog box that you have seen before.\n Once you have successfully embedded your audio files in the Region List, they should all be listed there. In the screenshot below, three files were imported: \u0026ldquo;toaster_8\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;short-drone-mono\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;wheels-mono\u0026rdquo;. The number [2] right after \u0026ldquo;toaster_8\u0026rdquo; indicates it is a stereo file. The other files without the number [2] are mono files.\nBy dragging and dropping an audio file listed on the Region List onto the Main Canvas, you can insert it in an existing track. If you drag it into an existing track, it will be added there. If you drag onto the empty space beneath existing tracks, a new track will be automatically created to accommodate it.\nRelease the mouse-click to complete the drag-and-drop operation. The Region will be inserted at the exact time point where you dropped it.\nIf a sound file is selected in the Editor List (i.e., if it is highlighted in blue), the next time you click on that file name Ardour will think you are trying to rename the Region (the name will become editable). More likely you were just trying to click to drag and drop the file onto a track. In order to click and drag a previously highlighted region from the list, you need to point and click in the empty space right before or after the name.\n Important: always make sure you are placing Stereo Regions on Stereo Tracks. If you drag a Stereo file onto a Mono Audio Track, only the left channel will be used. In the screenshot below, a stereo file with very distinct left and right channels was dragged onto a Stereo Track and a Mono Track. Notice that in the Mono Track only the left channel is displayed (and played back).Â Importing Audio Directly to a Track As mentioned earlier, the Add existing media dialogue also allows you to import audio files directly onto tracks.\nChoose Add files: as new tracks in order to automatically create a new track and add the selected file to it. The track will be named after the sound file name.\nIf you have previously selected one or more tracks, the menu will display the additional option Add files: to selected tracks in order to add a sound file into the already existing selected track.\nWhen adding files as new tracks, note that the Mapping options lets you choose between one track per channel or one track per file. For the purpose of this tutorial, choose one track per file, otherwise the left and right channels of a Stereo file will be split into two separate tracks.\nChoose Insert Point When using either one of the options above (\u0026ldquo;add as new track\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;add to selected tracks\u0026rdquo;), you should also specify where in the track you want the new Region to be placed. In the screenshot below, we are choosing \u0026ldquo;session start\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Region appears in a new track in the session. The new track automatically receives the name of the imported sound file.\nThe sound file will also appear in the Region List so that it can be inserted into other tracks as well (drag and drop).\nRemove Regions from Tracks To remove a region from a track, one can select it with the mouse and use the Cut function from the menu, the Control (or Apple) key and the X key, the Delete key or the key combination of fn and Backspace (which is used, for example, on a laptop keyboard that does not have a proper Delete key).\nSave your work often! The shortcut \u0026ldquo;Control\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; is your friend. Use it a lot, all the time.\n Continuing At this point, you may wish to add some new material to your Session by Recording Audio in the following chapter, or you may want to skip directly ahead to the Editing Sessions section to learn how to arrange the Regions you have Imported into a composition.\nNext: RECORDING AUDIO or ARRANGING TRACKS\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/using-plugins/","title":"Using plugins","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Plugins can be used to enhance or transform the sound of individual Tracks.\nThey can be applied directly to a single track, or to a group of Tracks using a Send. Later in this tutorial, we will discuss some Plugins specific to the Mixing process, such as Compressors, Limiters, Parametric Equalizers, Reverbs and others.\nProcessor Box In Ardour terminology, a Processor is anything which gets plugged into a Mixer Strip, and treats the signal in some way. Ardour provides several built-in processors such as the Fader or Panners. Processors can also be plugins used for effects or as instruments, as well as sends or inserts which affect signal routing. The arrangement of processors is arbitrary, and there is no limit to how many there can be.\nThe main space shown in the screenshot above is the Processor Box. The blue box Fader is in fact a Processor that comes by default inside the Processor Box. It represents the Fader that you use to control the Track\u0026rsquo;s volume. All Processors are shown as colored rectangles, with a small \u0026ldquo;LED\u0026rdquo; beside them that lights up when the processor is enabled. The colour of the processor depends on its location in the sequence; processors that are pre-fader are colored in red, and post-fader processors are colored green.\nAdding a Plugin to a Track or a Bus Plugins can be added by right-clicking in the Processor Box of the Track or Bus. A menu of options is presented. From the menu, new processors can be inserted.\nThe Plugin Manager is a convenient way to browse and choose plugins:\nFrom the Plugin Manager, you can search them by Name, Type, or other search parameters available from the drop-down menu. For example, we will add the reverb plugin called \u0026ldquo;Freeverb\u0026rdquo;:\nOnce selected, click \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; and the plugin will show up in the bottom list of \u0026ldquo;Plugins to be connected\u0026rdquo;. Then click \u0026ldquo;Insert Plugin(s)\u0026rdquo; and they will show up in the Processor Box.\nEditing Plugin Parameters Double-click a Plugin to edit its parameters. In this example, we double click the \u0026ldquo;Freeverb\u0026rdquo; green box and get this window:\nHere you can control reverb parameters such as Room Size, Damping, amount of Wet and Dry signal, and Width. The effect will apply to all sounds contained in the Track.\nBypassing Plugins To bypass the Plugin, press the Bypass button in the Plugin settings window, or simply click the \u0026ldquo;LED\u0026rdquo; of the plugin in the Processor Box. This turns the plugin off and allows the signal to pass by it unaffected. This is useful when you want to compare how a track sounds with and without the plugin.\nBypassed plugins are shown greyed out and with the \u0026ldquo;LED\u0026rdquo; turned off.\nRight-Clicking the Plugins will give a menu with several options, including Delete.\nPre-Fader vs Post-Fader You have a choice whether you would like to add your Plugin before or after the Fader rectangle in the Processor Box. Pre-fader plugins are inserted in the signal path before the Fader, so that the Fader controls the level of the signal coming out of the Plugin. Post-Fader Plugins are inserted after the Fader: the Fader controls the level of the signal going into the Plugin. For some Plugins, Pre- or Post-fader placement does not matter. For others, the difference is subtle. For others still, inserting them in the right place is absolutely essential (for more details, see for example this thread at the Ardour discussion forum).\nPlugin Formats For those interested in learning more about plugin formats, here\u0026rsquo;s a quick overview:\nLADSPA Plugins are the \u0026ldquo;native\u0026rdquo; Plugin format for Ardour.Â They were initially developed for Linux, but since have been ported to OS X as well.\nLV2 is a simple but extensible successor of LADSPA, which can be used to display sound characteristics in a graphical manner. LV2 Plugins can be used on OS X and Linux.\nAU Plugins are the \u0026ldquo;native\u0026rdquo; Plugin format for OS X. They will only work in Ardour if you have made a donation when you downloaded the program. See the Installing OS X chapter for details. AU Plugins will not work on Linux at all.\nVST Plugins is a Plugin format common to Microsoft Windows. Some VST Plugins can be used on Linux, however they may not function correctly, or even cause Ardour to crash. Using these Plugins requires manually Compiling the Ardour application, a task which is outside the scope of this manual.\nMore information about using plugins with Ardour can be found here: http://manual.ardour.org/working-with-plugins/\nContinuing In this chapter, we learned how to add a Plugin to a single Track. This is useful if that Track needs a specific Plugin, but if you have a Plugin which is used for many Tracks at the same time, you should continue to the next chapter about Using Sends. You can also continue to the various, Plugin-specific chapters such as Dynamics and Equalizing.\nNext: USING SENDS\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/working-with-regions/","title":"Working with regions","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Sections of audio are called Regions in Ardour.\nTo compose the short rhythmic passage we\u0026rsquo;ve been working on, we will need to know how to Select, Move, Split and Trim these Regions, as well as how to Fade In or Fade Out their volume and create Crossfades between them. Some of these options may need to happen at specific Edit Points in the composition, or according to the musical Meter we can define with the Timeline and the Grid as well.\nSelecting Regions The Grab Mode (shortcut \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo;) is the tool to select and move objects. It is located just below the Transport Menu in the Editor Window (the little \u0026ldquo;hand\u0026rdquo; icon). You will use this tool a lot in your Ardour work.\nWhen it is active, your mouse pointer will look like a little hand icon.\nTry all of the operations below, for practice:\n  Click on the Waveform of the region to select it. Click and drag on a region to move it around (left and right within the same track, but also up and down onto other tracks).\n  Use \u0026ldquo;Control\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;Click\u0026rdquo; to create and drag around a copy of the region.\n  You can select multiple regions by holding the \u0026ldquo;Shift\u0026rdquo; key while clicking on each region you want to select.\n  You can also drag a selection box over multiple Regions to select them all.\n    Move multiple regions at the same time after selecting them.\n  You can select several sequential regions on one track all at once by holding down the \u0026ldquo;Shift\u0026rdquo; key while selecting the first and the last Regions of the sequence (copy a few regions on the same track to try this out).\n  When you select a single Region, make sure to click on the Waveform section of its rectangle. The lower stripe with the Region name is used for a different action (see Trimming Regions below).\n  Use the \u0026ldquo;Del\u0026rdquo; key to delete selected regions.\n  Standard copy (\u0026quot;Control\u0026quot; + \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo;), cut (\u0026quot;Control\u0026quot; + \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo;), and paste (\u0026quot;Control\u0026quot; + \u0026ldquo;V\u0026rdquo;) operations also work with regions.\n  Moving Regions While moving a Region, a Timecode will appear on the screen in yellow numbers. This Timecode is the Region\u0026rsquo;s starting point on the Timeline. The unit of this timecode is the same as the unit of the First Clock, which you can change by right-clicking on the Second Clock and choosing a new unit (Minutes:Seconds, Bar:Beats, etc).\nYou can move Regions horizontally (sideways) to a different point in time on the same Track, or you can move the selected Region vertically (up or down) to a different Track.\nWhen a set of one or more Regions is selected, you can move the whole set by dragging with the mouse.\nMake sure to select the Region in its waveform section, because selecting the bottom title bar area is used for a different action (see Trimming Regions below).\n Duplicating Regions In addition to \u0026ldquo;Control\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;Click\u0026rdquo; + drag and standard copy/paste, Ardour offers other handy ways to duplicate regions. Use the Grab Mode (Select/Move Objects) to select one or more Regions, then use the Duplicate function to make one or more copies (menu Regions \u0026gt; Duplicate). Three options are available:\n Duplicate (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo;): make a copy of the selected region on the same track, immediately after the original. Multi-Duplicate (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Shift\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo;): make multiple copies of the selected region at once (same track, in sequence). You can specify the number of duplications. Fill Track: make as many copies of the selected region as needed to fill the entire track, all the way up to the End marker on the timeline.  In the following screenshot, regions have been duplicated using the methods above.\nUsing Edit Points When you use the standard copy/cut/paste commands, where exactly will the regions be pasted? The exact location is determined by the Edit Point drop-down menu.\nIf Mouse is selected as the Edit Point, the copied Region will be pasted at the current position of the mouse.\nIf Playhead is selected as the Edit Point, the copied Region will be pasted at red Playhead line on the same Track where the original Region is.\nFinally, if Marker is selected as the Edit Point, then the copied Region will be pasted immediately after the currently selected Location Marker.\nMarkers It is very useful to be able to tag different locations in a session for later use when editing and mixing. Ardour supports several ways for doing this. The most common method is using Location Markers, which define specific positions in time.\nLocation Markers can be added to the Timeline by right-clicking on the Location Markers strip and selecting Add New Location Marker. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see the Location Markers strip, right-click on the timeline and select it to make it visible. Location Markers can also be selected with the mouse and moved to new positions. Right-clicking on a location marker lets you rename the marker, among other options.\nWhen you first create a new session, two location markers are automatically added by default. These are the start and end markers that you see in the screenshot above. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see the end marker, zoom out enough and you will find it.\n Splitting Regions To Split a Region simply means to divide a single Region into two independent Regions. There are two ways of accomplishing this:\n You can use the Cut Mode (shortcut \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo;) to point and click anywhere you want to split; or You can stay in Grab Mode and use the shortcut \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; (for \u0026ldquo;Split\u0026rdquo;). In this last case, the point at which a Region will be split depends on the currently selected Edit Point. If Mouse is selected as your current Edit Point, select a Region and place the cursor at the point you would like to Split, then type \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; (same as going to menu Edit \u0026gt; Split Region).  After being split, the original single Region becomes two independent regions, with a new name for each, as in the image above. The two new regions are now entirely independent. You can move and edit them separately.\nRegions can also be split by using the Playhead or a Marker as the Edit Point.\nSplit Regions will receive a name derived from the original name of its parent region, and you will see this reflected in your regions List. For example, in the image above, you see two regions called pink.15 and pink.16, which means there were split from a parent Region called \u0026ldquo;pink\u0026rdquo; (not shown in image).\nSplitting ranges will follow your Grid settings. For example, if you have an active Grid set for Bars, splits will happen at the bar boundaries. If you choose \u0026ldquo;No Grid\u0026rdquo;, splits will happen wherever the Edit point is, regardless of any Grid.\n Trimming Regions If you move the cursor near the left or right side edge of a Region, you will see that the pointer becomes an arrow. Click and drag inwards from either end of the Region, and the Region will be shortened accordingly. This is called Trimming the Region. Regions can be trimmed from the start of the Region (drag from left to right at the edge) or from the end (drag from right to left).\nThis action is non-destructive: no audio is actually being deleted. It is as if you were just \u0026ldquo;hiding\u0026rdquo; those portions of the Region that you don\u0026rsquo;t want or don\u0026rsquo;t need anymore. Later on, you can \u0026ldquo;un-trim\u0026rdquo; the Region (i.e., extend it back to its original full size), even if it has been moved or copied to a new Track.\nLike Splitting, Trimming will obey Grid settings. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want your trimming to be constrained to any grid, simply turn the grid off (No Grid).\n Deleted Regions Because Ardour is non-destructive, the Regions you have deleted from tracks are not completely removed from the Session. They can always be accessed again from the Region List on the far right side of the Editor Window (Regions can be dragged from the list onto any tracks).\nCreating Fades in Regions A Fade is a change in the volume of a Region, either as the Region starts or as it ends. A Fade at the start of the Region is a Fade In, and at the end of a Region it is a Fade Out. Each Region has two small handles along the top corners, which can be dragged inwards from either edge to create a Fade In or Fade Out. The screenshot below shows a Fade In (indicated by the shaded area).\nIn fact, every Region has a Fade In and Fade Out built-in. By default, the region fade is very short, and serves to avoid clicks in the transitions at the start and end of the region. By adjusting the regions fade length as shown above, a more gradual transition can be accomplished.\nBy right-clicking on one of the Fades (the shaded area), the speed of the Fade can also be adjusted.\nCrossfading Between Two Regions When one Region Fades Out while another Fades In, this is called a Crossfade. If the two Regions are in different Tracks, you can use the method described above with the Fade In and Fade Out handles. The following screenshot shows an example.\nHowever, if both Regions are in the same Track, you need to overlap them in order to create a crossfade. When regions overlap on the same track, Ardour treats them as layers, that is, one of the regions is considered to be on top of the other. The important rule to understand is:\nThe Fade In (or Fade Out) of the topmost region represents the crossfade between the two regions.\nOnce you understand this principle, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to create and control crossfades between regions. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example. The two separate regions seen below will be made to overlap in order to create a crossfade.\nNote that we did not add any extra Fade Out to the first region, but we did add a longer Fade In to the second region. Then we drag the second region partly on top of the first:\nThe Fade In of the second region works now as the crossfade between the two regions. In other words, the first region will fade out in a mirror image way as the second region fades in.\nIn order for this to work, though, we need to make sure that the region that has the desired fade is on top in Ardour\u0026rsquo;s layering system. In order to change layering of regions, select a region and go to the menu Region \u0026gt; Layering.\nThe difference may be hard to hear if you are doing this with the very short percussive sounds we imported earlier. To really hear the effect, import a couple of longer samples to try it out (for example, a sample of rain sounds, and another of a human voice). Overlap several seconds of your long samples on the same track. You will hear the difference as you move the second region to the bottom (\u0026ldquo;Lower to Bottom\u0026rdquo;), and then back to top (\u0026ldquo;Raise to Top\u0026rdquo;). When it\u0026rsquo;s on top, we will hear the desired crossfade. When it\u0026rsquo;s at the bottom, we will hear no crossfade, just an abrupt change from first to second region (assuming your first region has no Fade Out specified, as in the screenshots above).\nUsing Grid Settings Experiment with the Grid setting, as discussed in the Setting Up the Timeline chapter, to give different kinds of Quantizationâin other words, to constrain the boundaries of each Region to certain grid points. Here, the Grid has been activated and set to Beats/16, to quantize the Regions to sixteenth notes within each bar. You may wish to Trim the endpoints of some of the samples, as discussed above, to fit within the metric structure you have set up (for example, the hihat samples in the screen below have been trimmed so that they don\u0026rsquo;t not overlap with each other).\nContinuing In the next chapter, we will explore a few more things you can do with Regions\nNext: FURTHER REGION OPERATIONS\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/further-region-operations/","title":"Further region operations","tags":[],"description":"","content":"In this section you will learn a few more things you can do with Regions.\nRight-clicking a selected Region reveals a context menu. The first item in the menu (labeled with the Region\u0026rsquo;s name) contains a large sub-menu. All of these operations are also available from Ardour\u0026rsquo;s main Region menu.\nThis section describes a few of the most commonly used operations accessible from these menus.\n Play: play back from the beginning to the end of that Region (shortcut \u0026ldquo;H\u0026rdquo;). Loop: set the loop range to fit that region\u0026rsquo;s duration, and start looping it right away. Rename: change a region\u0026rsquo;s name. Properties: lots of information on the region, plus ability to change its gain. Position: among other options, in this sub-menu you will find The Lock toggle box: it locks the Region so that it cannot be Moved or Trimmed. It can still be Split, however, and the resulting Regions will be unlocked. Edit: in this sub-menu you find useful tools such as Pitch Shift (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt + 8\u0026rdquo;) and Reverse (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt + 4\u0026rdquo;). Pitch Shift alters the pitch of a region without changing its duration. Reverse makes the region play backwards. Gain: useful options such as Mute (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt + 1), Normalize (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt + 3\u0026rdquo;), Boost Gain (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt + 6\u0026rdquo;), and Cut Gain (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt + 7\u0026rdquo;). Duplicate: includes Duplicate (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt + D\u0026rdquo;), Multi-Duplicate, and Fill Track. These were explained in detail in the chapter Working with Regions. Spectral Analysis: window displaying the overall frequency content of the Region.  Feel free to explore by yourself other sub-menus not mentioned above. Many of them are mirrors of the options you find under Ardour\u0026rsquo;s Region menu. Below we go into a bit more details on some of the most useful functions.\nPitch Shifting The Pitch Shift (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt + 8\u0026rdquo;) function alters the pitch of a region without changing its duration. The function applies a pitch-shifting algorithm to create a new audio clip based on the source clip.\nThe Pitch Shift window allows the user to specify the amount and direction of transposition desired. The window includes a Preserve Formants button. When pitch shifting by large amounts, the Preserve Formants option can give results that sound slightly more natural, particularly when used on vocal material.\nNormalize The Normalize function (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;3\u0026rdquo;) non-destructively boosts the level of the selected Region so that the Peaks are at 0 dB or less. When Normalizing to 0.0, the region will be as loud as possible while avoiding Clipping. Sometimes you may find useful to normalize a region to a value less than 0, such as -1.0, -3.0, or -6.0 decibels, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t become too loud.\nTwo other useful gain operations for regions are Boost Gain (\u0026ldquo;Alt\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;6\u0026rdquo;), and Cut Gain (\u0026ldquo;Alt\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;7\u0026rdquo;). Be sure to try them out.\nReverse The Reverse (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt + 4\u0026rdquo;) function reverses the selected region of audio, in effect causing it to play backwards. Reversing a region creates a new audio file \u0026lsquo;behind the scenes\u0026rsquo;.\nOperations on two or more selected Ranges If more than one range is selected, the operation will apply to all of them (for example, Normalize, Reverse, etc.)\nCombine Some operations from the context menu will only become available when two or more regions are selected. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the \u0026ldquo;Combine\u0026rdquo; function, under the sub-menu \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo;. First we select two adjacent regions:\nThen we choose \u0026ldquo;Combine\u0026rdquo; from the right-click context menu, or from Ardour\u0026rsquo;s main menu Region \u0026gt; Edit \u0026gt; Combine:\nAs a result, the selected regions are combined into one. This is particulary useful when you have found an exact sequence of regions that works just as you want, and then you would like to copy and/or move the whole sequence as group.\nNotice that the resulting combined region has the word \u0026ldquo;compound\u0026rdquo; attached to its name.\nContinuing In the following chapter, we will learn a bit more about the powerful tools Ardour has available by changing Edit Modes.\nNext: CHANGING EDIT MODES\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/appendices/license/","title":"License","tags":[],"description":"","content":"License All chapters copyright of the authors (see below).

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software\u0026ndash;to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0026rsquo;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author\u0026rsquo;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0026rsquo; reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0026rsquo;s free use or not licensed at all.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \u0026ldquo;Program\u0026rdquo;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a \u0026ldquo;work based on the Program\u0026rdquo; means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \u0026ldquo;modification\u0026rdquo;.) Each licensee is addressed as \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo;.\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\u0026rsquo;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\u0026rsquo; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u0026ldquo;any later version\u0026rdquo;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\nNO WARRANTY\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \u0026ldquo;AS IS\u0026rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/","title":"Mixing sessions","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Chapter 5 Mixing sessions How to use basic tools to make every instrument stand out in a mix\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/starting-sessions/recording-audio/","title":"Recording audio","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Besides Importing Audio, another way to create Regions in your Ardour session is to record new audio.\nThe source of this audio could be the line or microphone inputs of your audio interface, or it could even be sound originating from other applications on your computer which have been connected to Ardour via JACK. Please see the section on Routing for more details.\nThis section will show you how to record audio from an external source (for example, a microphone) onto a track in Ardour.\nFirst, you should check that the proper inputs have been routed to the track you wish to record to.\n Select the track by clicking on the empty space just below its name and volume slider. The Track becomes highlighted. The vertical strip Editor Mixer located on the left side of the Editor window should now show the Track you just selected (Audio 1 in the image above). Just below the Track name in the Editor Mixer you will find a button that allows you to edit the Routing. Click on that button to investigate the Routing.  If you don\u0026rsquo;t see the Editor Mixer strip, use the Shift + E shortcut to make it appear.\n In the next image you can see that the only input of this Mono Track is receiving signal from system capture_1. This normally means the first microphone input of your soundcard. The actual names of the connections on your personal computer may be different depending on a number of factors, including whether you are using a Mac, Windows, or Linux computer. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see a connection named system capture_1, look for whichever connection name is likely to be your input microphone.\nThe tabs that you see displayed vertically on the left are available sources. \u0026ldquo;Audio 1 in\u0026rdquo; on the bottom right is the destination. The green dot represents a connection.\nThe Ardour tabs show the connections that can be made from other sources within Ardour. The Other tab displays audio connections available from software other than Ardour. The Hardware tab shows hardware connections (for example, the built-in microphone of your computer or the inputs from your sound card). This will be explained in more detail in the Understanding Routing chapter.Â For the purpose of this chapter, simply make sure that system capture_1 (or equivalent in your computer) from Hardware tab is connected to the track you want to use so that we can do a test recording. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see a green dot as in the screenshot above, click on the matrix to make the connection manually. You can now close this window.\nThe example above assumes you are recording a Mono sound source onto a Mono Track. If you want to record in Stereo, the instructions are pretty much the same, but you should create a Stereo Track. You should then see two green dots, one for capture_1 and another for capture_2.\n Arming the Track Please be sure to first turn down the volume of your loudspeakers before the next step.\n\u0026ldquo;Arming the Track\u0026rdquo; is simply to get it ready for recording. Once you have checked that the proper capture inputs have been routed to the Track, you can arm the Track to record by clicking on the small red icon on the horizontal track strip (not the big one in the Transport controls).\nWhen properly armed, the small red icon will remain highlighted, and you will be able to see the incoming signal by looking at the Peak Meter on the Editor Mixer or on the horizontal Track strip.\nIf you are using headphones, you should be able to hear (\u0026ldquo;monitor\u0026rdquo;) the sounds being recorded. If you are using loudspeakers, be sure to turn their volume down to avoid feedback.\nUnless you have told Ardour to do otherwise, the input being recorded will be monitored (in other words, heard) via the Audition output. If you are not using headphones to monitor the recording process, you may get some loud feedback at this point!\n Arm Ardour and Start Recording Now that you have armed the Track to record, you must arm Ardour itself to record by clicking on the big red button in the Transport menu. The button will blink in red, indicating that Ardour is ready to record. To start recording, click on the Play button in the Transport menu, or press the space bar of your computer keyboard. Clicking the Play button again (or pressing the space bar) will stop recording.\nWhile recording, the armed Track will capture the sounds from the input. Any existing sound on other tracks will play normally during the recording. This allows you to play, sing or speak along with other Regions and Tracks you have already recorded or embedded in your Session.\nWhile recording, you will be able to see the Levels (the amplitude in Decibels) of the incoming sound, as well as see the Peaks of the Waveform appearing as it is recorded.\nAvoid Clipping The audio in the screenshot below was recorded too loud and produced Clipping (in other words, the signal recorded was outside the bounds of what could be represented digitally), which results in a loss of information and audible distortion. The clipped peaks in the waveform are marked in red.\nThe best and easiest way to avoid Clipping is have some control over the volume of the incoming audio signal before it gets to the sound card. For example, you can can move the microphone further away from the sound being recorded or use a mixer to reduce the volume of the incoming signal.Â When the audio signal has been recorded within proper limits, you should see no red Peaks, and the level meter should show a negative number as maximum peak (for example, a maximum peak of around â3.0 Decibels allows for a comfortable distance from the Clipping Point.)\nThe range of decibels between the region\u0026rsquo;s maximum Peak and the Clipping Point is commonly referred to as Headroom. It is common recording practice to keep approximately three to six Decibels of Headroom between the maximum of your signal and the Clipping Point, with the Clipping Point itself being represented as 0dB (zero Decibels). In other words, an audio region with a comfortable amount of Headroom would have its maximum Peaks between â6dB and â3dB.\nRegion List Recorded audio appears as a new Region in the recording Track. Like all Regions, this newly recorded one will be available in the Region List, from where you can drag-and-drop it into other Tracks if needed.\nThe Region you just recorded will automatically receive the name of the Track where it was recorded, with different takes being automatically numbered. In the screenshot below, \u0026ldquo;Audio 1-1\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Audio 1-2\u0026rdquo; represent two different recordings made on a track named \u0026ldquo;Audio 1\u0026rdquo;.\nYou might want to plan ahead and organize your recording Session by giving appropriate names to different tracks. For example, a Track used only for recording vocals can be named \u0026ldquo;Voice\u0026rdquo;. This way, recorded sound files will be named accordingly, and different takes will appear in the Regions List identified as \u0026ldquo;Voice-1\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Voice-2\u0026rdquo;, etc, rather than the default generic names, such as \u0026ldquo;Audio 1\u0026rdquo;.\nTo rename a Track, just double-click on its name (before you arm the track to record) and type in the new name.\nDid we mention how important it is to save your work often? Hit Ctrl + S right now. Get in the habit of hitting it every few minutes.\n Continuing At this point, you may want to skip directly ahead to the Arranging Tracks section to learn how to arrange the Regions into a composition. If you plan on doing more complicated Recording than what we have discussed here, in particular with a multichannel soundcard, or from other JACK-enabled audio programs on your computer, you should also have a look at the Understanding Routing chapter.\nNext: ARRANGING TRACKS or UNDERSTANDING ROUTING\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/using-sends/","title":"Using sends","tags":[],"description":"","content":"A Send is just an extra output for a Track or Bus with its own separate Fader that can be used to route the signal to other points in Ardour.\nAlso known as Auxiliary Sends, they tap the signal at a specific point in the signal flow (pre-fader, post-fader, before or after EQs and other plugins, etc.) and send a copy of that signal somewhere else, without affecting the normal signal flow downwards to the channel fader.\nIn Ardour, you can easily add Sends to Tracks and Busses through the Mixer Strip. Sends are Processors, just like Plugins.\nWhen is a Send useful? In earlier chapters, we built a drum kit pattern with four separate tracks: kick, snare, hihat, and clap. Let\u0026rsquo;s say now you\u0026rsquo;d like to add a reverb to the drums. You could of course add a separate plugin for each individual track, and tweak their settings separately, but this method unnecessarily increases the amount of work. Every time you want to change a reverb setting across the board for all drums, you\u0026rsquo;d have to open all four reverb plugins and change them in the same way.\nThis is where Sends come in handy: you can use them to add a particular effect to a set of Tracks without creating multiple instances of the same Plugin.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the overview of how we will do this:\n Create a single Bus with the desired Plugin. Add a Send to each drum track to which you want to apply the effect. Route these Sends to the Bus.  Creating the Bus and adding a Plugin Create a Bus (menu Track \u0026gt; Add Track, Bus, or VCA\u0026hellip;), name it appropriately, and add a Plugin in the Pre-Fader Region (right-click just above the Fader blue rectangle in the Processor Box), as discussed in the chapter Using Plugins.\nIn this example, we have created a Mono Bus called \u0026ldquo;DRUMS\u0026rdquo;, and added the \u0026ldquo;Freeverb\u0026rdquo; Reverb LADSPA Plugin to the bus.\nBus inputs The \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; display in the Bus Input button indicates that nothing is routed to this bus yet. We will take care of this later.\nBus output Before routing a send to this Bus, first make sure that the Bus outputs are Routed to the Master Bus, as shown below (button at bottom reads \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo;).\nAlso, open the Plugin Window (double click on the Freeverb rectangle) and set the Plugin\u0026rsquo;s signal mix to 1.0 Wet Level and 0.0 Dry Level.\nThis ensures that the Bus carries all of the processed signal (the \u0026lsquo;Wet\u0026rsquo; signal) from the Plugin, and none of the unprocessed signal (the \u0026lsquo;Dry\u0026rsquo; signal) to the Master Bus. Remember, the unprocessed, \u0026lsquo;clean\u0026rsquo; signals are still available from their original tracks, so there is no need to duplicate them in this Bus.\nCreating and Routing Sends Now we can create Sends in the other Tracks and route them to the Bus inputs.\nLike Plugins, Sends are also created in the Processor Box. Go to each of your drum tracks, right-click in empty space of the Processor Box, and create a New Aux Send\u0026hellip; directed to the appropriate Bus (in our case, named DRUMS).\nIf you do not see the \u0026ldquo;New Aux Sends\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; option in the menu, it\u0026rsquo;s probably because you did not create any bus yet. Go back to the previous step to create the bus.\n You should now see the Send displayed in the Processor Box:\nThe little \u0026ldquo;Send\u0026rdquo; slider you see just below the green rectangle is the Send Fader, which controls how much sound will be sent from this Track to the Bus.\nPost-Fader vs Pre-Fader Sends Notice that the image above shows a Post-Fader Send (it sits \u0026ldquo;after\u0026rdquo; the Fader rectangle). In Post-Fader Sends, the Send Level is controlled first by both the Track/Bus Fader and second by the Send Fader.\nIn a Pre-Fader Send, on the other hand, the Send Level is controlled only by the Send Fader, independently of the Track/Bus Fader. A Pre-Fader Send would look like this:\nYou can drag the Send rectangle up and down the Processor box to make it Pre- or Post-Fader as needed.\nThe choice of Pre- or Post-Fader depending on the type of effect Plugin used and the desired result. For this exercise, either one will work.\n A Send behaves just like any other Plugin in the Processor Box. You can deactivate it temporarily by clicking on the small \u0026ldquo;LED\u0026rdquo;, and you can right click on the rectangle to access other options, including \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo;.\nSend Fader To control level of each Send, simply click and drag the Send Fader to increase or decrease its volume.\nThe DRUMS Bus is now receiving the sum of all tracks, and applying the effect to it. A single Plugin applied to the Bus controls the effect for the mix of all drum sounds routed there. This way, you have independent control over the \u0026ldquo;dry\u0026rdquo; sound of the original tracks, and the \u0026ldquo;wet\u0026rdquo; sound of coming out of the Bus.\nBecause Sends are very useful for this kind of work with effect Plugins, they are also commonly called \u0026ldquo;Effect Sends\u0026rdquo;.\nContinuing Now that you know how to Add Plugins to a Track, as well as how to Add Sends to Tracks to create Plugin Busses usable by any number of Tracks, it might be helpful to learn about a few other Plugins useful in the Mixing Process. Please continue on to the following chapters covering Dynamics and Equalizing.\nNext: DYNAMICS\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/changing-edit-modes/","title":"Changing edit modes","tags":[],"description":"","content":"We have already learned a bit about the Grab Mode (select/move objects) and Range Mode. In this chapter we will get an overview of all the Edit Modes and Cursor Modes available on that part of the Editor Window.\nEdit Modes and Cursor Modes These controls define the behavior of the main canvas and the different functions of the cursor.\nThe drop-down Edit Mode menu contains three options. Slide Edit is the standard mode, and the one we will be using in this tutorial. It allows you to freely drag regions around horizontally (within the same track) and vertically (between tracks). The other two options limit or block your ability to move regions from their positions, but we will not cover them in detail here.\nGrab Mode (shortcut \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo;) This Cursor Mode allows you to select or move objects such as regions and breakpoints (in an automation curve). When this Cursor Mode is selected, your cursor pointer will look like a little hand icon.\nRange Mode (shortcut \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo;) This Cursor Mode allows you to click and drag to define or resize time Ranges.Â When this Cursor Mode is selected, your cursor pointer will look like a vertical line. Time ranges can be selected over one or several tracks, depending on the selection of your tracks.\nCut Mode (shortcut \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo;) Use this Cursor Mode to split Regions into smaller Regions. The cursor turns into the shape of scissors. This allows you to point and click on a Region to split it at the cursor.\nYou can cut Regions directly from the Grab Mode too (sometimes this method can be more practical.) Without leaving the Grab Mode, simply place the mouse at the desired location on the Region to be cut, and hit the shortcut \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; (for \u0026ldquo;split\u0026rdquo;). Important: your Edit Point (to the right of the Grid settings) must be set to Mouse.\n Stretch/Shrink Region (shortcut \u0026ldquo;T\u0026rdquo;) This Cursor Mode allows you to drag and resize the duration of an entire Region without changing the Pitch. This is sometimes called \u0026lsquo;Time stretching\u0026rsquo;, hence the shortcut \u0026ldquo;T\u0026rdquo;. Please see the chapter on Stretching/Shrinking Regions for more details. When this Cursor Mode is selected, your cursor pointer will look like a diagonal arrow.\nAudition Mode (listen to specific regions) This Cursor Mode allows you to click on any existing Region on any track and have it immediately played back. Playback stops at the end of the Region. When this Cursor Mode is selected, your cursor pointer will look like a small loudspeaker icon.\nYou can also quickly audition a selected Region without leaving the Grab Mode. Simply select a Region and hit the shortcut key \u0026ldquo;H\u0026rdquo;.\n Draw Mode (shortcut D) Use this mode to draw gain automation points. Cursor looks like a pencil. Automation will be discussed in detail in the chapter Using Automation.\nYou can also edit individual points in this mode if you bring your cursor right on top of the automation point you want to move (mouse will turn into a small cross). However, if you are not precise this may accidentally create a new automation point. If this becomes a problem, you should use the next Mode, which only allows for editing existing points, not creating new ones.\nInternal Edit Mode (shortcut E) Use this mode to edit existing gain automation points. Cursor looks like a hand, and turns into a small cross when you are on top of an existing point. Click (hold the click down) and drag in order to move points.\nMIDI The last two buttons explained above are also used to create and edit MIDI information.\nHorizontal Zoom and view options The main shortcuts you will probably be using all the time are \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;=\u0026rdquo; (zoom out and zoom in, respectively). Zooming will happen in relation to the Edit Point currently chosen (Mouse, Marker, or Playhead). If in doubt of which Edit Point to choose, try Mouse.\nThe Zoom to Session button (shortcut \u0026ldquo;_\u0026rdquo; - that\u0026rsquo;s the underscore character) zooms in or out as needed so that you can see the Start and End markers of your project.\nAll the zoom options discussed above control the amount of horizontal content you will be seeing on screen. Once you have a session with several tracks, you will also want to control the amount of vertical content you are able to fit (see) on the screen. There are several ways to do this:\n Use the \u0026ldquo;Number of visible tracks\u0026rdquo; drop down menu to select how many tracks you want to fit on your screen. Use the \u0026ldquo;Shrink tracks\u0026rdquo; button to make all selected tracks smaller. Use the \u0026ldquo;Expand tracks\u0026rdquo; button to make all selected tracks larger. You can also change an individual track size by dragging from its bottom edge, or right clicking on the track header and selecting the desired \u0026ldquo;Height\u0026rdquo;.  The navigation tool You can use the navigation tool at the bottom of the Editor window in order to scroll up and down the session, and adjust horizontal and vertical zoom by adjusting the size of the viewing rectangle.\nContinuing In the following chapter, we will see how to take the Regions we have edited and Creating Looped Sections from them.\nNext: Creating looped sections\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/dynamics/","title":"Dynamics","tags":[],"description":"","content":"One of the problems you may encounter in a Mix is that the loud parts are too loud, and/or the quiet parts are too quiet.\nThis kind of problem cannot be easily solved using Faders to adjust the Levels alone. You may set the Levels so high that they clip, or you may add unwanted background noise by simply turning Levels up. These are all problems with what is called the Dynamic Range, i.e., the difference between the loudest and quietest parts of your Session. There are several types of tools for adjusting the Dynamic Range available as Plugins within Ardour, including Limiting, Compression and Gating.\nLimiting A Limiter is a tool that prevents the volume of a Track from going over a certain Level, usually the Peak Level (0dB) or something close to it. Many Limiters have the option to boost the Levels of the incoming signal before they are Limited, and in this way you can \u0026ldquo;close the gap\u0026rdquo; between the loudest and quietest parts of your Mix. A Limiter can be used on the Master Bus to prevent the overall Mix from Clipping. Limiters are almost always used Post-Fader.\nIn the example below, a Plugin named \u0026ldquo;Fast Lookahead Limiter\u0026rdquo; is used (if you don\u0026rsquo;t find that specific one among your installed plugins, look for any other called \u0026ldquo;Limiter\u0026rdquo;). To set how much it limits, simply adjust the \u0026ldquo;Limit (dB)\u0026rdquo; slider. The Fast Lookahead Limiter literally \u0026ldquo;looks ahead\u0026rdquo; in the signal by a few milliseconds, and when it sees that the signal is about to go over the limit you have set, it automatically turns the Levels down.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Input Gain (dB)\u0026rdquo; slider determines how much the Levels are increased before they reach the Limiter, and the \u0026ldquo;Attenuation (dB)\u0026rdquo; meter on the right-hand side shows how much the Levels are being reduced at any given moment. While the reduction in volume is nearly-instantaneous, the \u0026ldquo;Release time (s)\u0026rdquo; slider determines how long it takes the Limiter to return to 0 Decibels of Attenuation.\nNote that the \u0026ldquo;harder\u0026rdquo; one drives the Limiter (by increasing the Input Gain and/or decreasing the maximum Peak Limit allowed), the more reduction the Limiter is forced to make, and the more likely it is that Artifacts of the processing will occur (such as Distortions or erratic changes in volume). On the Master Bus, it is generally best to avoid excessive Limiting.\nCompression A Compressor boosts the overall volume of a sound, but then \u0026ldquo;squeezes\u0026rdquo; it depending on how loud it is. This can make vocals sound more even or drums sound fuller and louder. The end effect is similar to how a Limiter can reduce the range between the quietest and the loudest sound, however the effect is more selective when using a Compressor.\nThe simplest Compressor has relatively few controls, such as the \u0026ldquo;Simple Compressor\u0026rdquo; Plugin shown below. Here, the \u0026ldquo;Threshold\u0026rdquo; sets the Level at which the Compressor will start to act, and the \u0026ldquo;Compression Ratio\u0026rdquo; controls how much the Compressor will \u0026ldquo;squeeze\u0026rdquo; the sound. The \u0026ldquo;Attack\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Decay\u0026rdquo; parameters control how quickly the Compressor affects the sound.\nA more complex Compressor, the \u0026ldquo;SC1 Compressor\u0026rdquo; Plugin, is show below.\nIt has three main buttons:\n \u0026ldquo;Threshold level (dB)\u0026rdquo; sets the level at which the Compressor will compress or squeeze the sound. \u0026ldquo;Ratio (1:n)\u0026rdquo; controls how much it will squeeze when it reaches the threshold. \u0026ldquo;Makeup gain (dB)\u0026rdquo; boosts the whole signal after the Compression occurs.  To soften out a vocal, for example, you could set a \u0026ldquo;Threshold level\u0026rdquo; of â10dB or so and a \u0026ldquo;Ratio\u0026rdquo; of 2.5, and then bring the volume back up with the \u0026ldquo;Makeup gain\u0026rdquo;.\nThe other three controls â \u0026ldquo;Attack time (ms)\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Release time (ms)\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Knee radius (dB)\u0026rdquo; â allow you to control the shape of the Compression.\nFor soft vocal Compression, you would want a semi-fast \u0026ldquo;Attack time\u0026rdquo; so that the Compressor catches the beginning of each word, a slower \u0026ldquo;Release time\u0026rdquo; to let the voice ring out, and a soft \u0026ldquo;Knee radius\u0026rdquo; to create a gentle form of compression that isn\u0026rsquo;t too noticeable.\nIf you want to make drums sound big, you might try a slow \u0026ldquo;Attack time\u0026rdquo; so that you don\u0026rsquo;t Compress the pop of the drum, a fast \u0026ldquo;Release time\u0026rdquo; so that the Compressor can catch the next hit of the drum, and a large \u0026ldquo;Ratio\u0026rdquo; to make the Dynamics between the beginning and end of the drum hit similar.\nBelow is a screenshot of a similar Compressor from the Calf Plugins Package:\nGating The simplest kind of Gate allows a signal to pass through when it is over a certain Level, and blocks the signal when it is lower than that.\nGates are often used as a kind of noise reduction. For example, the Gate on a microphone channel might only open while the singer is singing, preventing other background noises from coming through as well when she is not singing. Gated drums are also a very well-known studio production trick to make them sound \u0026ldquo;sharper\u0026rdquo;.\nHere, the \u0026ldquo;Hard Gate\u0026rdquo; Plugin displays a single control parameter, the \u0026ldquo;Threshold\u0026rdquo; at which the Gate will open and let the signal through.\nOther kinds of Gates, such as the Calf Gate Plugin, are more complex. They have independent control over how quickly the Gate opens (the \u0026ldquo;Attack\u0026rdquo;) and closes (the \u0026ldquo;Release\u0026rdquo;), as well as other parameters quite similar to those described for the SC Compressor above.\nContinuing Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve explored some tools for getting the Dynamic Range exactly where you want it, it\u0026rsquo;s time to look at adjusting the balance of Frequencies present in each individual Track and in your overall Mix. In the next chapter, we\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to use the Equalizer to do just that.\nNext: EQUALIZING\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/exporting-sessions/","title":"Exporting sessions","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Chapter 6 Exporting sessions How to export a region, a selection of data, and a whole session\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/starting-sessions/understanding-routing/","title":"Understanding routing","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Routing an audio signal is sending it from somewhere to somewhere else.\nIn addition to getting audio signals to and from Ardour, routing plays an important part inside Ardour itself. Examples of using routing inside Ardour include routing audio from Tracks to the Master Bus or to other Busses, creating \u0026lsquo;sends\u0026rsquo;, routing the outputs from Busses to the Master Bus, etc. (see chapter on Creating a Track for an explanation of Tracks and Busses). All routing, both internal and external to Ardour, is handled by JACK.\nRouting in Ardour The standard routing of inputs, tracks and busses in Ardour is determined when a new Session is created in the Advanced Options of the New Session dialog box (see Starting a Session chapter). By default, the routing is as follows:\n The audio device inputs are routed to the Track inputs. All outputs from Tracks and Busses are routed to the master bus inputs. The Master Bus outputs are routed to the audio device outputs.  Note that when a new Bus is created, nothing is routed to its input.\nThis routing setup makes sense for sessions containing only Tracks, but to make use of any Busses (other than the Master Bus) or to get creative with the paths of the audio signals inside Ardour, we need to be able to change the routing.\nThe Audio Connection Manager window (also known as the patchbay) is the main way to make connections to, from ,and within Ardour\u0026rsquo;s mixer. You can open this window with the shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;N\u0026rdquo;, or through the menu Window \u0026gt; Audio Connections.\nThe patchbay presents two groups of ports; one set of sources, and one of destinations. Sources and destinations are organized by tabs. The available sources are displayed vertically on the left side, and the destinations are displayed horizontally at the bottom.\nIn the screenshot below, notice that the \u0026ldquo;Hardware\u0026rdquo; tab is selected on the top left (that\u0026rsquo;s a source), and the \u0026ldquo;Ardour Tracks\u0026rdquo; is selected as a destination in the bottom. This means that the matrix you see displays connections from available hardware sound sources (for example, a microphone), into existing Ardour tracks.Â The green dots represent a connection. The screenshot above tells us that incoming sounds from \u0026ldquo;system: capture_1\u0026rdquo; (the first input source of your soundcard, or the built-in microphone of your laptop) are going into Ardour track named \u0026ldquo;Audio 1\u0026rdquo;, and also that incoming sounds from \u0026ldquo;system: capture_1\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;system: capture_2\u0026rdquo; are respectively going into the Left and Right inputs of Ardour track named \u0026ldquo;Audio 2.\u0026rdquo;\nNotice we can see that \u0026ldquo;Audio 1\u0026rdquo; is a Mono track because it only has one connection slot, while track \u0026ldquo;Audio 2\u0026rdquo; is Stereo since it has two slots (Left and Right).\nThe next screenshot shows the signal path from Ardour Tracks (selected vertical tab) into Ardour Busses (selected horizontal tab). As mentioned earlier, the default setting for all Ardour Tracks is that their sound goes to the Master Bus.\nNote: remember that \u0026ldquo;Audio 1\u0026rdquo; is a Mono track? We saw it in the earlier screenshot that \u0026ldquo;Audio 1\u0026rdquo; only has one input slot. But now on the screenshot above you see that \u0026ldquo;Audio 1\u0026rdquo; has two outputs (Left and Right). This is normal: we define whether a track is Mono or Stereo by its number of inputs, not outputs. Mono tracks will hold a single channel of audio, but you can still choose to place the sound on the left or the right speaker (or anywhere in between). More on this in the chapter Panning.\nFinally, let\u0026rsquo;s explore a couple more tabs in the Audio Connection Manager to see the sound going from the Master Bus to the actual hardware outputs (your loudspeakers or headphones):\nAs you can see, the selected source tab is now \u0026ldquo;Ardour Busses\u0026rdquo;, and the destination tab is \u0026ldquo;Hardware\u0026rdquo;. This session happens to have only one bus, the default \u0026ldquo;master out\u0026rdquo;. The green dots show that all sounds coming out of the Master Bus are going to system playback 1 and 2, which are the outputs of your soundcard.\nHow to connect and disconnect? To make a connection, click on the desired empty square in the matrix; a green dot will appear to indicate the connection is made.\nTo undo a connection, simply click on an existing green dot and it will disappear.\nPractical example of routing to a bus In the following example session, there are two guitar Tracks and one unused Bus called Guitar Bus, all Stereo.\nSuppose you want to send the output from the two guitar Tracks to the Guitar Bus instead of the Master Bus. This can be useful to control the volume of both guitars with just one Fader (in this case the Guitar Bus fader). Then the output of the Guitar Bus, which is the sum of the two guitars, goes directly to the Master Bus.\nHere is how to edit the patchbay to get the desired routing. Select \u0026ldquo;Ardour Tracks\u0026rdquo; tab from Sources (vertical tabs), and \u0026ldquo;Ardour Busses\u0026rdquo; from destinations (horizontal bottom tabs). Undo existing connections from both Tracks to Master. Then create connections from both Tracks to Guitar Bus. The final result would look like this:\nNow both guitar tracks are routed to the Guitar Bus, and no longer directly connected to the Master Bus. We then make sure that the Guitar Bus is, by its turn, routed to the Master Bus (the output routing of a Bus is edited in the same way as for a Track), so that we can still hear the sound from both guitar Tracks. Now we can control the volume of both guitar Tracks together by changing the Fader of the Guitar Bus. What\u0026rsquo;s more, we can now add Plugins to the Guitar Bus to process the sound of both guitar Tracks together.\nTrack- or Bus-specific views of the Patchbay The Audio Connection Manager (Patchbay) that you open with Alt + P shows you the complete matrix of every single source and every single destination available in Ardour. Sometimes this is too much: you just want to quickly change the routing of a single track input or output, for example. Ardour allows you to access a relevant subset of Patchbay connections when you click directly on the Inputs or Outputs button of a Track or Bus in the Mixer Strip.\nThe Inputs button is at the top, and the Outputs button is on the bottom of the strip. Clicking on either one will show you a menu of connection options. In the screenshot below, for example, you would click on the \u0026ldquo;1/2\u0026rdquo; button right under the track name \u0026ldquo;Guitar-1\u0026rdquo; in order to access this menu:\nYou may select a connection right there from the menu, or choose \u0026ldquo;Routing Grid\u0026rdquo; to see a simpler version of the Audio Connection Manager with only the Inputs or Outputs of the selected Track or Bus.\nAll Ardour connections are JACK connections It is important to realize that any routings that you make or disconnect from within Ardour are in fact JACK routings, which you can see from other applications like Qjackctl, Catia, or JackPilot, depending on your Operating System. Below is an example of a Catia window (Linux only) displaying the same JACK connections discussed above:\nContinuing In this chapter, we covered how to manage Routing inside Ardour, or between Ardour and the sound card. However, one of the strengths of using the JACK system is that it can also manage connections between applications on the same computer. To gain a better understanding of how this works, please continue to the chapter Routing Between Applications. If you would prefer to work only with Ardour, then skip ahead to the section on Arranging Tracks.\nNext: ROUTING BETWEEN APPLICATIONS or ARRANGING TRACKS\nÂ "},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/creating-looped-sections/","title":"Creating looped sections","tags":[],"description":"","content":"You can easily repeat sections of audio in your Ardour session.\nHere, we take the short rhythmic passage we created in Working with Regions and duplicate it to make a loop.\nBefore duplicating the passage, it is a good idea to combine individual regions in the same track into a single one: it is easier to move them around this way, and it prevents you from accidentally moving a single hihat out of place, for example. There are two ways of doing this: Combine Regions (allows you to \u0026ldquo;uncombine\u0026rdquo; later on), and Consolidate Range (\u0026ldquo;writes it in stone\u0026rdquo;, does not allow you to separate them later).\nIf you are still planning on making alterations to the rhythm (adding, removing, or moving individual regions), it may be better to use the Combine regions option. If you like the sequence the way it is and don\u0026rsquo;t want or don\u0026rsquo;t care to have the ability to separate them later, use Consolidate Range option.\nCombine Regions Simply select all the regions you want to combine:\nThen go to menu Region \u0026gt; Edit \u0026gt; Combine (or right-click on the selected regions and find the same option through the context menu, as shown below):\nThe combined regions will look like this (note the word \u0026ldquo;compound\u0026rdquo; appended to the name):\nShould you need to separate them again in the future, simply select the compound region and go to the same menu and choose the option \u0026ldquo;Uncombine\u0026rdquo;.\nConsolidating the Range A more permanent alternative to Combine is to use Consolidate. When you\u0026rsquo;ve arranged your Regions into a single \u0026ldquo;loop cycle\u0026rdquo; and you\u0026rsquo;re satisfied with the sound, create a Range with all the regions that will make up the loop. First, make sure every Track used in the loop is selected. Unselected Tracks are gray, and selected ones are blue. If any of the Tracks you used are not selected, hold down the Shift key while clicking on them to add them to the selected group. Finally, use the Range tool to select the entire loop.Â Once again, the Grid setting will help you to set the range precisely to the start and end points of your metric bar. Once you have the entire loop selected, Right-Click on the range and select \u0026ldquo;Consolidate range\u0026rdquo;. If you would like any Automation or Plugin effects you have added to the loop to be included, select \u0026ldquo;Consolidate range with processing\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen the range is Consolidated, new Regions will appear in each Track, each containing all the repetitions of the samples which you set up in the previous steps. Remember, once the range is consolidated, there is no way to undo this operation. In any case, if you find that you need to alter the rhythm in any way, you can always retrieve the original individual samples from the Region List and rebuild the pattern with them.\nDuplicating the Range After you have merged individual regions that form your pattern (using either Combine or Consolidate), it\u0026rsquo;s time to duplicate the pattern to make it loop for several bars.\nThe Multi-Duplicate feature (seen in the Working with regions chapter) is a good way to accomplish this. Go back to Grab mode (shortcut G), select all regions, and hit Shift + D. Choose how many times you want to duplicate the pattern (for example, 16). After duplication our session looks something like this:\nJust for review, other options you could have used for duplication are:\n  The Fill Track command from menu Region \u0026gt; Duplicate \u0026gt; Fill Track. This would fill the entire track with copies of the selected regions, all the way up to the End Marker.\n  The single Duplicate command from the same menu (shortcut \u0026ldquo;Alt\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo;). This lets you make a single copy at a time.\n  The single duplicate action with \u0026ldquo;Control\u0026rdquo; + Click on the region + Drag a copy.\n  Continuing In the next tutorial we will learn about Stretching/Shrinking Regions that are longer or shorter than one bar in order to fit the rhythm of our passage.\nNext: STRETCHING/SHRINKING REGIONS\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/equalizing/","title":"Equalizing","tags":[],"description":"","content":"An Equalizer (or EQ) allows you to separately control the gain of different frequency ranges of a sound.\nThis can be useful not only to sculpt the timbre of an isolated sound (for example, to make it sound \u0026lsquo;sharper\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;smoother\u0026rsquo;), but also to make sounds of various timbres to integrate better into the Mix.\nOften, even after adjusting Levels and Panning, different tracks with similar frequency content (for example, a bass guitar and a kick drum) may be difficult to tell apart in the Mix. An Equalizer is a good tool to address this.\n3-Band Equalizer The simplest kind of Equalizer is the one familiar to us from analog mixers. It has three parameters, which adjust the Levels of three Bands, or frequency ranges: one for the Bass (low frequencies), one for the middle range frequencies and one for the Treble (high frequencies). The \u0026ldquo;DJ EQ\u0026rdquo; Plugin is just such an EQ. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have this particular plugin on your computer, explore the ones you have that have \u0026ldquo;EQ\u0026rdquo; in the name; you will likely find something similar.\nMulti-Band (or Graphical) Equalizer A more complex Multi-Band (or Graphical) Equalizer often has a lot more bands. Each Band is centered on a frequency, and the Level of each band can be independently adjusted. In some Multi-Band EQs, such as the \u0026ldquo;TAP Equalizer\u0026rdquo; plugin shown below, the center frequency of each Band can be defined by the user. This allows you to either attenuate (or remove) an unwanted frequency, or to reinforce (boost) a desired one.\nThe overall \u0026ldquo;curve\u0026rdquo; of the Bands can also be used to determine the general tone of your Track or Mix. In the example above, the lower part of the mid-range frequencies have been \u0026ldquo;scooped out\u0026rdquo; a bit (note how Bands 1 and 8 are left untouched at 0 dB, while intermediary Bands 2 to 7 draw an attenuation curve, with Band 4 at -15 dB as the lowest point).\nParametric Equalizer The Parametric Equalizer is the most versatile type of EQ used for Mixing because of its extensive control over all types of EQ parameters. Ardour ships with a Parametric Equalizer plug-in called the \u0026ldquo;a-EQ\u0026rdquo;. It looks like this:\nOthers may have shinier graphical interfaces like this one from the Calf Plugins package, but they all essentially do the exact same thing. You may have EQ plugins on your computer that look a bit different than these screenshots, but the parameters you can control are likely very similar.\nIn both screenshots above (a-EQ and Calf EQ), there are options you can adjust for each frequency band. Each of the three bands has a \u0026ldquo;Level (dB)\u0026rdquo; adjustment to cut or boost frequencies, a \u0026ldquo;Frequency (Hz)\u0026rdquo; adjustment to select center frequency, and a \u0026ldquo;Q\u0026rdquo; adjustment (between 0 and 1) which determines how wide the range of frequencies to be affected will be.\nHigh Shelf, Low Shelf Both plugins shown above (a-EQ and Calf) also contain a High Shelf and Low Shelf. A Shelf cuts or boosts everything above (High Shelf) or below (Low Shelf) a specific frequency. For example, a Low Shelf can be used to remove unwanted rumbling sounds, and a High Shelf can be used to reduce hiss. The \u0026ldquo;Frequency\u0026rdquo; control of a Shelf determines the cut-off frequency. For example, a Low Shelf with cut off frequency 200 Hz means that the equalizer will attenuate everything below that frequency. The amount of attenuation is controlled by the Level knob. Notice that neither the High Shelf nor the Low Shelf have a Q parameter.\nAn Example of Using an Equalizer In order to achieve a better separation of two instruments in the Mix through the use of EQ, you first need to find out where the two instruments overlap.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s one approach.\n  Using a-EQ or any equivalent EQ plugin, select an appropriate band for one of the instruments. In the case of a bass guitar, it would be a low frequency band (start at, say, 100 Hz).\n  Boost the \u0026ldquo;gain\u0026rdquo; to 10dB, change the \u0026ldquo;Q\u0026rdquo; (also called \u0026ldquo;bandwidth\u0026rdquo;) so that is a narrower range, and then scroll the \u0026ldquo;frequency\u0026rdquo; up and down slowly. You\u0026rsquo;ll hear a pitch move up and down.\n  Scroll it down slowly until you hear the frequency range where the two instruments overlap. Now simply reduce the \u0026ldquo;gain\u0026rdquo; to -5dB, and you will hopefully hear the instruments a bit clearer. Next, apply the same process to the other instrument.\n  There are many approaches to EQ. Hopefully this will provide one example of how to begin EQ\u0026rsquo;ing Tracks in your Mix. But most importantly, when it comes to EQ, it is better to use too little than too much, unless you\u0026rsquo;re consciously using extreme EQ as a compositional parameter.\nContinuing You should have enough tools now to create a clean, well-balanced Stereo Mix of your Session. However, if you want the parameters of your Faders, Panning or Plugins to change over Time, then you will want to explore the Using Automation chapter next.

This chapter shows how to accomplish that.\nThe examples on this page were created on a computer running Ubuntu Linux. Beware that things may work differently if you are on another OS (in particular if you are using a Mac, in which case you will be using JackPilot). The general principles are always the same, though.\nFrom your browser to Ardour Web browsers (Firefox, Chromium, etc) are not JACK-aware applications. Luckily, systems such as KXStudio and UbuntuStudio come with a bridge application between regular system audio (like PulseAudio) and JACK. This tutorial assumes you are using a computer with this bridge already running and working.\nThe overall steps to record audio from YouTube (or any other sound coming from your browser) into Ardour are:\n Create a Stereo Track in Ardour Disconnect Hardware sources from Track inputs Connect PulseAudio Jack Sink to Track inputs Start recording into the Track Start playing the YouTube video  For this example, a new session was created with a new Stereo Track named \u0026ldquo;Firefox\u0026rdquo;:\nThen we select the Track and click on the Inputs button on the Editor Mixer strip. In the screenshot above, it\u0026rsquo;s the button just below the track name (\u0026quot;Firefox\u0026quot;) in the Editor Mixer strip (it shows only a \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; (dash)in the example above, meaning that there are no connections made yet). We are presented with the Patchbay window specific to that Track\u0026rsquo;s inputs.\nFirst thing to do is to disconnect any microphone inputs from that track (\u0026quot;system capture\u0026quot;), if any. After disconnecting, this part of matrix for the \u0026ldquo;Firefox\u0026rdquo; Track should look like this (no green dots):\nNext step is to change tabs in this same window. Choose \u0026ldquo;Other\u0026rdquo; as the source. This is where you will find other running applications that can be sound sources to Ardour. On a Linux computer with PulseAudio Jack bridge, you will see \u0026ldquo;PulseAudio JACK Sink\u0026rdquo; as a source. Click on the appropriate empty squares to create connections (green dots) between \u0026ldquo;front-left\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;front-right\u0026rdquo; to the Left and Right inputs of the \u0026ldquo;Firefox\u0026rdquo; Track. It should eventually look like this:\nNow you are ready to go. Simply follow the same recording procedures explained in the Recording Audio chapter: record-enable (arm) the Track (small red circle on the track), arm Ardour to record (big red button; it starts blinking), then hit the Play button. Go back to your browser and start playing the YouTube video.\nFrom JACK-aware applications to Ardour Other music software like SuperCollider, Hydrogen, and PureData are JACK-aware. This means they will show up directly as source and destination options in Ardour\u0026rsquo;s Audio Connection Manager. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about any PulseAudio / Jack bridge as in the YouTube example above.\nThe procedure is essentially the same: create a Mono or Stereo Track to record the audio, set that Track\u0026rsquo;s inputs to the desired source, and record as usual.\nThe screenshot above was taken while recording a drum pattern from Hydrogen directly into an Ardour track named \u0026ldquo;from Hydrogen\u0026rdquo;. Hydrogen\u0026rsquo;s window is on the right. Ardour\u0026rsquo;s Patchbay window was left open for demonstration: notice that the application \u0026ldquo;Hydrogen\u0026rdquo; shows up as a source under the \u0026ldquo;Other\u0026rdquo; tab. It is connected directly to the inputs of the track. Also notice that SuperCollider (another jack-aware application) happened to be open at the same time, though its window is not visible in this screenshot. SuperCollider provides 8 default sound outputs, all of which show up as potential sources in Ardour\u0026rsquo;s Patchbay.\nContinuing This concludes the Getting Started chapters. Now that you have some audio imported, recorded from a line or microphone input, or even from another application, proceed to the Arranging Tracks section and learn how to arrange your composition.\nNext: ARRANGING TRACKS\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/saving-sessions/","title":"Saving sessions","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Chapter 7 Saving sessions How to save a session, a snapshot of it, and a template for further reuse\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/appendices/","title":"Appendices","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Chapter 8 Appendices Where to find more info about Ardour and how to improve this tutorial\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/stretching-shrinking-regions/","title":"Stretching &amp; shrinking regions","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Regions can be stretched or shrunk in length without changing their Pitch by using the Stretch/Shrink Regions tool (shortcut \u0026ldquo;T\u0026rdquo;, for \u0026ldquo;Time stretch\u0026rdquo;).\nA small adjustment to the length of a Region may not cause noticeable sound Artifacts. However, the more extreme the change in length, the more obvious the effect of processing on the sound.\nTo use Stretch/Shrink Regions, place your cursor on top of the region, and then Click-drag left or right. While dragging, you will see a highlighted area, which represents the new duration to which the Region will be shrunk or stretched when you release the mouse at the current position.\nTime-Stretching a Region to Fit the Loop In the image below, we\u0026rsquo;ve added another sound sampleâthis time, a synthesizer lineâfrom freesound.org to the rhythmic passage we composed in the Creating Looped Sections chapter (search for \u0026ldquo;1168 so synth\u0026rdquo; in the Search Freesound tab of Ardour if you\u0026rsquo;d like to get the same sample. Import it as a new track).\nAfter importing this synth line, we see that the length of our new Region doesn\u0026rsquo;t match the existing rhythm we\u0026rsquo;ve already created. It\u0026rsquo;s too long to be one bar and too short to be two bars.\nWe can correct this by using the Stretch/Shrink tool. Select the Region you wish to stretch, and drag the new length to the end of the second Bar, again assisted by the Grid settings.\nWhen you release the mouse button, the Time Stretch Audio dialog will appear. You can experiment with different settings for the Time Stretch operation. Each will affect the sound in different ways. It\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to experiment with a few different stretch settings to find out which gives the result you\u0026rsquo;re most happy with.\nClick Stretch/Shrink in the Time Stretch dialog to start the operation.\nWhen the Time Stretch operation is complete, the region of the synthesizer line will now be exactly two Bars long, and should fit in with the rhythm we already created with the drum samples.\nContinuing This was the last chapter of the Editing Regions section. Next we go into Mixing.\nNext: MIXING SESSIONS\n"},{"uri":"https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/using-automation/","title":"Using automation","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Automation is a way of dynamically changing audio processing parameters over time.\nUp to now, we have used fixed values for various parameters of our Tracks (for example, a Track Fader set to -3.0 dB; or a Mono Panner set to 100% Left; etc.) These fixed values would apply for the entire Track throughout the whole Session.\nBut what if you would like these values to change over time in a pre-determined way? For example, you may want to have the Gain of a Track to gradually decrease over twenty seconds. Or you may want to make a sound move from Left to Right over two seconds.\nThis is accomplished with Automation. The Fader, Panning, and any of the parameters of the Plugins used in that Track can be automated. An automated parameter is displayed underneath the parent track in its own Automation Track. Automation data is visually represented as an Automation Line, made up of a number of Automation Points. Here\u0026rsquo;s how a track with Automation looks like:\nIn the image above, the Automation Track called \u0026ldquo;Fader\u0026rdquo; is associated to the parent Track called \u0026ldquo;Audio 1\u0026rdquo;. The Automation Line controls Fader (volume) changes over time.\nCreating a Fader Automation Line Let\u0026rsquo;s create a simple Fader Automation. Click the \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; button of a chosen track. A menu will appear, where you can select the parameter you would like to Automate. Choose \u0026ldquo;Fader\u0026rdquo;.\nAn Automation Track will then appear. Select the Draw Mode (shortcut \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo;):\nNow you can create Automation Points by clicking anywhere in the Automation Track. An Automation Line joins the Automation Points you add. The yellow number (-15.3 decibels in the image below) indicates the Gain level for the selected Automation Point.\nAutomation States The Automation Curve will not play, however, until you set the Automation State to \u0026ldquo;Play\u0026rdquo;.\nManual: When set to \u0026ldquo;Manual\u0026rdquo;, the Track will ignore any Automation data. It will just play with whatever volume is the Fader is set to. In this mode, you are able to move the Track Fader by hand to set a new fixed level. That\u0026rsquo;s the default behavior of a Track when it\u0026rsquo;s first created.\nPlay: When set to \u0026ldquo;Play\u0026rdquo;, the Track will automatically change the Gain levels following the Automation Curve drawn in the Automation Track. You will no longer be able to move the Track Fader by hand. During playback, you will see the Track Fader moving up and down according to the curve.\nWrite mode will continuously record user changes to the Automated parameter as the Transport plays, creating an Automation Line. For instance, you may start playback and then make real-time changes in gain using the Fader of your Track. All the changes you make will be written (recorded) as an Automation Line, which then you can play back later by switching the Automation Mode back to Play\nTouch mode is similar to Write mode. Unlike Write mode though, Touch mode won\u0026rsquo;t record over existing Automation data unless the parameter is being changed.\nIf these concepts are new to you, focus now on just the first two modes (Manual and Play), and practice creating automation by drawing Automation Curves by hand.\nCreating a Plugin for Automation You may add Automation to any Plugin which has already been added to a Track. In the example below, we have a \u0026ldquo;AM pitchshifter\u0026rdquo; Plugin added to a track.\nIn order to select a Plugin parameter for Automation, click the button on the Track marked \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo;. The menu will appear. Under \u0026ldquo;Processor Automation\u0026rdquo; you will find a listing of the Plugins you have added for that Track.\nWithin each listed Plugin, you may choose which parameter you want to Automate from a list. In the example, we chose the parameter \u0026ldquo;Pitch shift\u0026rdquo; of the Plugin \u0026ldquo;AM pitchshifter\u0026rdquo;. An Automation Track for that parameter appears. Note that as you open several Automation Tracks, they will appear one after the other below the main parent Track.\nDraw an automation curve for that parameter. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to set the Automation State to \u0026ldquo;Play\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the image above, the pitch shift of the sound is now changing over time, controlled by the curve.\nYou can hide an Automation Track by clicking on the \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; at the upper left corner of the Automation Track. Note that a hidden Automation Track continues to function even when it is not visible.\n Adding Better Visual Resolution to Automation You can achieve a greater amount of vertical precision by increasing the height of the Automation Track. Move your cursor near the lower edge of the Automation Track. The pointer turns into a vertical double arrow. Drag it down to increase the height of the Automation Track. Notice that the parent Track and the Automation Track heights are independent, so while working in your Automation Curves you might set them up like this:\nRemember you can also Zoom In and Out to increase resolution in the horizontal axis.\n Working with Automation Points There are several ways ways of adjusting Automation Points, depending on the editing mode you are in:\n An Automation Point can be dragged in any direction with the mouse (works in Grab, Draw, and Edit modes). To remove an Automation Point, hold down the \u0026ldquo;Shift\u0026rdquo; key while Right-Clicking on it (works in Grab, Draw, and Edit modes). Edit Mode only: any segment of the Automation Line between Automation Points may be dragged vertically, affecting both end points at once, without affecting their horizontal position. Simply click somewhere on the line between two points, and drag up and down. How to delete multiple Automation Points at once (Grab Mode and Edit Mode only): select multiple Automation Points by dragging a box starting on the track background around the points. Then the selected points may be deleted by hitting \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; (not \u0026ldquo;Backspace\u0026rdquo;). If you are on a Mac and do not have a true \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; key, try \u0026ldquo;Function\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;Backspace\u0026rdquo;).  After an Automation Curve ends, its value will stay at that level for all subsequent regions, whether or not you have drawn a continuation of the curve.\nIn the example above, the last point of the curve is at -23 decibels. That same level will be kept for the remainder of the Track, even though the line is not drawn until the end.\nMoving Automation Moving a Region to a new location will automatically move the Automation data that might be aligned with it, as we can see in the following screen shots.\nBefore moving:\nAfter moving:\nYou can change this behavior if you like. In other words, if you want automation curves to stay where they are even when you move Regions around, go to Edit \u0026gt; Preferences \u0026gt; Editor and uncheck \u0026ldquo;Move relevant automation when audio regions are moved.\u0026rdquo;\nRegion-specific Gain Automation There is a way to create a gain automation directly bound to a Region. When you select Draw Mode, you should see a flat line on the top half of each Region rectangle:\nClick directly on that line to create Automation points. These will be drawn directly on the Region itself, unlike Fader Automation which is drawn or recorded in the Automation track. Region Gain Automation is separate from, and in addition to, Fader Automation.\nAs with the Automation Tracks, a Gain Automation Point can be dragged in any direction with the mouse. To remove a Gain Automation Point, hold down the \u0026ldquo;Shift\u0026rdquo; key while Right-Clicking on it.\nDeactivating and Removing Gain Automation Gain Automation can be reset or deactivated from the Region context menu, which is reached by Right-Clicking on the Region.\nHere, the Gain Automation is referred to as the Envelope.\n\u0026ldquo;Reset Envelope\u0026rdquo; removes the Gain Automation Points you have drawn in the Region.\n\u0026ldquo;Envelope Active\u0026rdquo; toggles the Gain Automation Envelope on and off.\nWhen should I use Region Gain Automation or Track Fader Automation? As seen above, both are very similar. With practice you will notice situations in which one is more convenient than the other. Here are two examples:\n If all you need to do is a little touch up (cut or boost gain) in a specific portion of a Region, and you are otherwise happy with the level for the Rest of the passage or entire track, use the Region-specific Automation.   If you have a more complex Track with crossfades over Regions, and/or need to shape a longer dynamic curve across several Regions on the same Track, use Fader Automation.  The screenshot above shows a simple gradual fade starting from the first Region in the track, and ending at the last Region. It\u0026rsquo;s very straightforward to do this with Fader Automation, but but it would be much harder to do it using region-specific automation.\nContinuing Once you have your Automation in place, you are just about ready to Export your Stereo Mix to an audio file which you can listen to, burn as a CDR or convert to an MP3/OGG to share on a website.
