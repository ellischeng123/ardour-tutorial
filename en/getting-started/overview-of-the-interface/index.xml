The Editor window is the most important window in Ardour, as this is how you will control the program as well as see and edit the audio and MIDI data you have recorded or imported.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at main parts of the Editor window:
Here they are:
Editor-specific toolbar Timeline Tracks and busses Project overview Editor mixer strip Regions, Tracks/Busses, Snapshots, Groups, Ranges, Marks Let&amp;rsquo;s overview them quickly.</description></item><item><title>Mixer window</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/overview-of-the-interface/mixer-window/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/overview-of-the-interface/mixer-window/</guid><description>The Mixer window, can be viewed by going to the main menu and clicking Window &amp;gt; Mixer &amp;gt; Show Mixer. Alternatively, you can press Alt+M.
TODO: not just display mixer strips, but control gain and plugins etc.
The main function of the Mixer window is to display all the mixer strips for the various tracks and busses side by side for easy reference. This window is mainly used during the mixing process.</description></item><item><title>Recorder window</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/overview-of-the-interface/recorder-window/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/overview-of-the-interface/recorder-window/</guid><description>The Recorder window is streamlined for one particular use case: recording to multiple tracks. The interface is pointedly simplified to remove all distraction.
There are three major sections in the Recorder window as outlined above:
Window-specific toolbar The timeline and the tracks representation Inputs control Window-specific toolbar The toolbar has specific commands and information: arming and disarming all tracks for recording, discarding the last take, automatically switching all inputs for signal monitoring, estimation of the time you can record to the disk until it&amp;rsquo;s out of free space etc.</description></item><item><title>Cue window</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/overview-of-the-interface/cue-window/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/overview-of-the-interface/cue-window/</guid><description>TODO
Continuing Now that you are familiar with main Ardour&amp;rsquo;s windows, let&amp;rsquo;s jump to the next section where we create a new track and then import some audio file.
