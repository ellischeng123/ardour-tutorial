The Editor Window is the most important window in Ardour, as this is how you will control the program as well as see and edit the audio you have recorded or imported.
At the top of the Editor Window are several main areas: the Transport Menu, the Clocks, the Edit Modes/Cursor Modes menu, the Snap Mode menu and the Auxiliary Controls.</description></item><item><title>Mixer window</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/overview-of-the-interface/mixer-window/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/overview-of-the-interface/mixer-window/</guid><description>Mixer Window Controls The second window, the Mixer Window, can be viewed by going to the main menu and clicking Window &amp;gt; Mixer.
