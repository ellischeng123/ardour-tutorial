Mouse Clicks Ardour requires a two-button mouse to run (or the emulation of that on your system in some other way). A click is assumed to be a left button mouse click. A right-click refers to the right-hand button on the mouse. A Ctrl, Cmd or Apple key pressed with a mouse click is not the same and may in fact give a different result.</description></item><item><title>Editor window</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/overview-of-the-interface/editor-window/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/overview-of-the-interface/editor-window/</guid><description>When you create a new session, Ardour opens an empty new window called the Editor window. The Editor window is the most important window in Ardour, as this is where you arrange track, import and edit media on the timeline, and control plugin automation for creative effects and mixing.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at main parts of the Editor window:
Here they are:
Editor-specific toolbar Timeline Tracks and busses Project overview Editor mixer strip Regions, Tracks/Busses, Snapshots, Groups, Ranges, Marks Let&amp;rsquo;s overview them quickly.</description></item><item><title>Exporting regions</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/exporting-sessions/exporting-a-region/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/exporting-sessions/exporting-a-region/</guid><description>You may wish to Export only a Region of your Session, perhaps to use as a sample in another application, or to Edit it in a different editor program. This chapter shows you how.
Exporting a Region To Export a Region, select it (so it becomes blue), and then right-click into the sub-menu Export, or use the top menu: Region &amp;gt; Export.
This will open up the same Export dialog box explained in the Exporting a Session chapter.</description></item><item><title>Further help</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/appendices/further-help/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/appendices/further-help/</guid><description>Besides the URLs listed in the Links chapter, there are a couple of resources on the Internet to help you learn Ardour and fix some of the problems that you might have along the way.

What does non-destructive editing actually mean? In a nutshell, a non-destructive approach to editing means this: whatever you do, your source material always stays intact.</description></item><item><title>Saving a session</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/saving-sessions/saving-a-session/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/saving-sessions/saving-a-session/</guid><description>There are a number of ways to save Sessions in Ardour, so that each Session can be use later on. The simplest way is to save the entire Session just like you would save other documents: hitting &amp;ldquo;Control&amp;rdquo; + &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo;.
A new Session is first saved at the moment you create it. While you are working on it, you should save it frequently. Get into the habit of hitting &amp;ldquo;Control&amp;rdquo; + &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;Command&amp;rdquo; + &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; on a Mac) every few minutes.</description></item><item><title>Starting Ardour</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/starting-ardour-on-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/starting-ardour-on-ubuntu/</guid><description>Ardour supports both Linux, Windows, and macOS. There is very little difference about how it works on all these operating systems. So while this tutorial assumes using Ubuntu Linux, you should expect it to work the same way on other operating systems and Linux flavors.
First-launch wizard When you first start Ardour, it will ask you a few questions to make a basic customization: user interface and font scale (if you have a HiDPI display), default folder where new sessions would be created, preferred way to monitor signal being recorded etc.</description></item><item><title>The mixer strip</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/the-mixer-strip/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/the-mixer-strip/</guid><description>Mixing is the process of converting multiple Tracks into a Stereo Mix where all the instruments can be heard clearly.
Mixing Tools Levels, Panning, Equalization (EQ), and Compression are the main tools used to achieve a good Mix. In addition to these core tools, a wide range of Plugin effects can also be used to enhance the sound, such as Reverb and Delay.Â Introducing the Mixer Strip The Mixer Strip is the vertical column that contains various controls related to signal flow.</description></item><item><title>Arranging tracks</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/arranging-tracks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/arranging-tracks/</guid><description>In the following chapters we will use Ardour to create a short rhythmic passage using several drumkit samples.
We will continue working on this passage in later tutorials, such as Working with Regions and Creating Looped Sections. We assume that you have read the chapters in the Getting Started section already, and are familiar with Importing Audio, Tracks, and the Timeline.
Importing Samples The first step is to add some sounds, which is discussed at length in the Importing Audio chapter.</description></item><item><title>Exporting a range</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/exporting-sessions/exporting-a-range/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/exporting-sessions/exporting-a-range/</guid><description>Learn how to export a selected portion (Range) of your Session.
Exporting is the process of saving a Region, Track or Session to a file on your computer. As we learned previously, exporting an isolated Region does not export all of the changes you might have made to that Region. To export edits such as Panning, Fader Automation, and Plugin effects, you must Export either a Range or the entire Session.</description></item><item><title>Exporting a session</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/exporting-sessions/exporting-a-session/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/exporting-sessions/exporting-a-session/</guid><description>Exporting is the process of saving a Region, Track, or entire Session to a file on your computer which you can listen to, burn as a CD-R, or convert to an MP3 to share on a website.
Export the Entire Session Once you have finished your composition, the most common export operation is to export the entire Session to an audio file.
Bird&amp;rsquo;s Eye View of Entire Session At this point it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to Zoom Out and take a look at your whole session before exporting.</description></item><item><title>Glossary</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/appendices/glossary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/appendices/glossary/</guid><description>This glossary offers brief definitions for many or the terms used throuhout the Ardour3 FLOSS Tutorial.
Aggregate Device (Mac OS X) An Aggregate Device is one virtual soundcard made of of two or more physical soundcards. PowerBooks and MacBooks made in 2007 or later will need this set up in order for JACK to have both input and output channels. This is set up in the Audio MIDI Setup application.</description></item><item><title>Mixer window</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/overview-of-the-interface/mixer-window/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/overview-of-the-interface/mixer-window/</guid><description>The Mixer window, can be viewed by going to the main menu and clicking Window &amp;gt; Mixer &amp;gt; Show Mixer. Alternatively, you can press Alt+M.
TODO: not just display mixer strips, but control gain and plugins etc.
The main function of the Mixer window is to display all the mixer strips for the various tracks and busses side by side for easy reference. This window is mainly used during the mixing process.</description></item><item><title>Mixing levels</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/mixing-levels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/mixing-levels/</guid><description>Levels are the volumes of each Track relative to the others.
If you can&amp;rsquo;t hear a bass line above the other instruments, the obvious choice would be to raise the bass line volume. Levels can be adjusted using the Fader in the Mixer Strip or in each Track, just below the Track name. The first step in Mixing is to listen to everything that has been recorded and adjust the levels of all Tracks so you can hear everything clearly, but in a manner that is appropriate for the song.</description></item><item><title>Saving a snapshot</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/saving-sessions/saving-a-snapshot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/saving-sessions/saving-a-snapshot/</guid><description>Saving a Snapshot in Ardour is similar to saving your Session to a new file, however using a Snapshot avoids overwriting the original Session file. A Snapshot contains the current state of your work, while sharing all the audio and data files of the Session.
Saving a Snapshot You can save a Snapshot via the menu: Session &amp;gt; Snapshot (shortcut &amp;ldquo;Control&amp;rdquo; + &amp;ldquo;Shift&amp;rdquo; + &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo;).
By default the program will name the new Snapshot according to the current date and timestamp of your system.</description></item><item><title>Setting up the meter</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/setting-up-the-meter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/setting-up-the-meter/</guid><description>The Meter determines the musical speed of the passage we are composing, as measured in Beats Per Minute.
If we are composing something rhythmic, it will also determine the lengths of the sound samples we use to some extent. So it is important to be able to set up the Meter before we continue.
To see the meter-related timelines for our session, we can right-click anywhere in the &amp;ldquo;header&amp;rdquo; of the Rulers and check the following options: Meter, Bars &amp;amp; Beats, and Tempo.</description></item><item><title>Creating tracks and busses</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/creating-tracks-and-busses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/creating-tracks-and-busses/</guid><description>What is an audio track? An audio track is a place where you can drag a region from your region list and where you can record sounds coming from an outside source.
A region represents an audio clip, i.e., one of your sound files or just a portion of a sound file. In the image below, the horizontal strip areas marked &amp;ldquo;MyTrack&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;short-drone-mono&amp;rdquo; are tracks. The rectangles containing audio information are called regions (for example, the region &amp;ldquo;wheels-mono.</description></item><item><title>Links</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/appendices/links/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/appendices/links/</guid><description>Useful links:

Once you have established a good balance of levels on all the Tracks, you can begin to think about panning.
The Panning Interface The Panning control in Ardour is located in the middle of the mixer strip.
A Mono Track will have a Mono Panner. It looks like this:</description></item><item><title>Recorder window</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/overview-of-the-interface/recorder-window/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/getting-started/overview-of-the-interface/recorder-window/</guid><description>The Recorder window is streamlined for one particular use case: recording to multiple tracks. The interface is pointedly simplified to remove all distraction.
There are three major sections in the Recorder window as outlined above:
Window-specific toolbar The timeline and the tracks representation Inputs control Window-specific toolbar The toolbar has specific commands and information: arming and disarming all tracks for recording, discarding the last take, automatically switching all inputs for signal monitoring, estimation of the time you can record to the disk until it&amp;rsquo;s out of free space etc.</description></item><item><title>Saving a template</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/saving-sessions/saving-a-template/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/saving-sessions/saving-a-template/</guid><description>If you often go through the motions of setting up the same information in each new Session you create, such as the number of input and output Channels, the number and names of Tracks or Busses, or the Routing, then you may wish to create a Template of that information instead.
With a Template, you can save the state of a currently open Session without all the Region information files. Templates are useful if, for example, you&amp;rsquo;re doing extensive Routing on Tracks and Buses and want to save the Editor Window&amp;rsquo;s state for use in other Sessions.</description></item><item><title>Using ranges</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/using-ranges/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/using-ranges/</guid><description>A Range is a selection of the Timeline that can include one or more Tracks.
The Range tool (shortcut &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo;) is located just below the Transport Menu in the Edit Window.
When you have selected the Range tool, your mouse pointer will look like a vertical line.
It can be useful to create Range selections that align with the edges of regions on your Timeline. Selecting the &amp;ldquo;Grid&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Region bounds&amp;rdquo; items for Grid and Grid Point menus respectively makes this easy.</description></item><item><title>What is digital audio?</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/introduction/what-is-digital-audio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/introduction/what-is-digital-audio/</guid><description>Ardour is a digital audio workstation (DAW). Beforing using it to record and edit sound, it might be useful to review how digital audio works.
The diagram above shows how sound travels to and from your computer. The &amp;ldquo;Analogue to Digital Conversion&amp;rdquo; (ADC) and the &amp;ldquo;Digital to Analogue Conversion&amp;rdquo; (DAC) are done by the sound card or audio interface.

To compose the short rhythmic passage we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on, we will need to know how to Select, Move, Split and Trim these Regions, as well as how to Fade In or Fade Out their volume and create Crossfades between them. Some of these options may need to happen at specific Edit Points in the composition, or according to the musical Meter we can define with the Timeline and the Grid as well.</description></item><item><title>Further region operations</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/further-region-operations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/further-region-operations/</guid><description>In this section you will learn a few more things you can do with Regions.
Right-clicking a selected Region reveals a context menu. The first item in the menu (labeled with the Region&amp;rsquo;s name) contains a large sub-menu. All of these operations are also available from Ardour&amp;rsquo;s main Region menu.
This section describes a few of the most commonly used operations accessible from these menus.

The timeline settings are one of the obvious options there, because what you want to see on the timeline largely depends on the kind of material you work on.
Users creating audio plays, documentaries, reportages or soundscapes may wish to use minutes and seconds for units, while those recording bands or producing electronic music will most likely use bars and beats.</description></item><item><title>Using sends</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/using-sends/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/using-sends/</guid><description>A Send is just an extra output for a Track or Bus with its own separate Fader that can be used to route the signal to other points in Ardour.
Also known as Auxiliary Sends, they tap the signal at a specific point in the signal flow (pre-fader, post-fader, before or after EQs and other plugins, etc.) and send a copy of that signal somewhere else, without affecting the normal signal flow downwards to the channel fader.</description></item><item><title>Changing edit modes</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/changing-edit-modes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/changing-edit-modes/</guid><description>We have already learned a bit about the Grab Mode (select/move objects) and Range Mode.

This kind of problem cannot be easily solved using Faders to adjust the Levels alone. You may set the Levels so high that they clip, or you may add unwanted background noise by simply turning Levels up.

In addition to getting audio signals to and from Ardour, routing plays an important part inside Ardour itself. Examples of using routing inside Ardour include routing audio from Tracks to the Master Bus or to other Busses, creating &amp;lsquo;sends&amp;rsquo;, routing the outputs from Busses to the Master Bus, etc. (see chapter on Creating a Track for an explanation of Tracks and Busses).</description></item><item><title>Creating looped sections</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/creating-looped-sections/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/creating-looped-sections/</guid><description>You can easily repeat sections of audio in your Ardour session.
Here, we take the short rhythmic passage we created in Working with Regions and duplicate it to make a loop.
Before duplicating the passage, it is a good idea to combine individual regions in the same track into a single one: it is easier to move them around this way, and it prevents you from accidentally moving a single hihat out of place, for example.</description></item><item><title>Equalizing</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/equalizing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/equalizing/</guid><description>An Equalizer (or EQ) allows you to separately control the gain of different frequency ranges of a sound.
This can be useful not only to sculpt the timbre of an isolated sound (for example, to make it sound &amp;lsquo;sharper&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;smoother&amp;rsquo;), but also to make sounds of various timbres to integrate better into the Mix.
Often, even after adjusting Levels and Panning, different tracks with similar frequency content (for example, a bass guitar and a kick drum) may be difficult to tell apart in the Mix.</description></item><item><title>Routing between applications</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/recording-audio/routing-between-applications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/recording-audio/routing-between-applications/</guid><description>Sometimes you may need to record the audio output of another program into Ardour (for example, the sound of a YouTube video playing in Firefox, or the output of SuperCollider or PureData). This chapter shows how to accomplish that.
The examples on this page were created on a computer running Ubuntu Linux. Beware that things may work differently if you are on another OS (in particular if you are using a Mac, in which case you will be using JackPilot).</description></item><item><title>Stretching &amp; shrinking regions</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/stretching-shrinking-regions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/editing-sessions/stretching-shrinking-regions/</guid><description>Regions can be stretched or shrunk in length without changing their Pitch by using the Stretch/Shrink Regions tool (shortcut &amp;ldquo;T&amp;rdquo;, for &amp;ldquo;Time stretch&amp;rdquo;).
A small adjustment to the length of a Region may not cause noticeable sound Artifacts. However, the more extreme the change in length, the more obvious the effect of processing on the sound.
To use Stretch/Shrink Regions, place your cursor on top of the region, and then Click-drag left or right.</description></item><item><title>Using automation</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/using-automation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/mixing-sessions/using-automation/</guid><description>Automation is a way of dynamically changing audio processing parameters over time.
Up to now, we have used fixed values for various parameters of our Tracks (for example, a Track Fader set to -3.0 dB; or a Mono Panner set to 100% Left; etc.) These fixed values would apply for the entire Track throughout the whole Session.
But what if you would like these values to change over time in a pre-determined way?</description></item></channel></rss>
