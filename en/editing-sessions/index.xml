We will continue working on this passage in later tutorials, such as Working with Regions and Creating Looped Sections. We assume that you have read the chapters in the Getting Started section already, and are familiar with Importing Audio, Tracks, and the Timeline.
Importing Samples The first step is to add some sounds, which is discussed at length in the Importing Audio chapter.</description></item><item><title>Setting up the meter</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour7-tutorial.github.io/en/editing-sessions/setting-up-the-meter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour7-tutorial.github.io/en/editing-sessions/setting-up-the-meter/</guid><description>The Meter determines the musical speed of the passage we are composing, as measured in Beats Per Minute.
If we are composing something rhythmic, it will also determine the lengths of the sound samples we use to some extent. So it is important to be able to set up the Meter before we continue.
To see the meter-related timelines for our session, we can right-click anywhere in the &amp;ldquo;header&amp;rdquo; of the Rulers and check the following options: Meter, Bars &amp;amp; Beats, and Tempo.</description></item><item><title>Using ranges</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour7-tutorial.github.io/en/editing-sessions/using-ranges/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour7-tutorial.github.io/en/editing-sessions/using-ranges/</guid><description>A Range is a selection of the Timeline that can include one or more Tracks.
The Range tool (shortcut &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo;) is located just below the Transport Menu in the Edit Window.
When you have selected the Range tool, your mouse pointer will look like a vertical line.
It can be useful to create Range selections that align with the edges of regions on your Timeline. Selecting the &amp;ldquo;Grid&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Region bounds&amp;rdquo; items for Grid and Grid Point menus respectively makes this easy.</description></item><item><title>Working with regions</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour7-tutorial.github.io/en/editing-sessions/working-with-regions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour7-tutorial.github.io/en/editing-sessions/working-with-regions/</guid><description>Sections of audio are called Regions in Ardour.
To compose the short rhythmic passage we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on, we will need to know how to Select, Move, Split and Trim these Regions, as well as how to Fade In or Fade Out their volume and create Crossfades between them. Some of these options may need to happen at specific Edit Points in the composition, or according to the musical Meter we can define with the Timeline and the Grid as well.</description></item><item><title>Further region operations</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour7-tutorial.github.io/en/editing-sessions/further-region-operations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour7-tutorial.github.io/en/editing-sessions/further-region-operations/</guid><description>In this section you will learn a few more things you can do with Regions.
Right-clicking a selected Region reveals a context menu. The first item in the menu (labeled with the Region&amp;rsquo;s name) contains a large sub-menu. All of these operations are also available from Ardour&amp;rsquo;s main Region menu.
This section describes a few of the most commonly used operations accessible from these menus.
Play: play back from the beginning to the end of that Region (shortcut &amp;ldquo;H&amp;rdquo;).</description></item><item><title>Changing edit modes</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour7-tutorial.github.io/en/editing-sessions/changing-edit-modes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour7-tutorial.github.io/en/editing-sessions/changing-edit-modes/</guid><description>We have already learned a bit about the Grab Mode (select/move objects) and Range Mode. In this chapter we will get an overview of all the Edit Modes and Cursor Modes available on that part of the Editor Window.
Edit Modes and Cursor Modes These controls define the behavior of the main canvas and the different functions of the cursor.
The drop-down Edit Mode menu contains three options. Slide Edit is the standard mode, and the one we will be using in this tutorial.</description></item><item><title>Creating looped sections</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour7-tutorial.github.io/en/editing-sessions/creating-looped-sections/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour7-tutorial.github.io/en/editing-sessions/creating-looped-sections/</guid><description>You can easily repeat sections of audio in your Ardour session.
Here, we take the short rhythmic passage we created in Working with Regions and duplicate it to make a loop.
Before duplicating the passage, it is a good idea to combine individual regions in the same track into a single one: it is easier to move them around this way, and it prevents you from accidentally moving a single hihat out of place, for example.</description></item><item><title>Stretching &amp; shrinking regions</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour7-tutorial.github.io/en/editing-sessions/stretching-shrinking-regions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour7-tutorial.github.io/en/editing-sessions/stretching-shrinking-regions/</guid><description>Regions can be stretched or shrunk in length without changing their Pitch by using the Stretch/Shrink Regions tool (shortcut &amp;ldquo;T&amp;rdquo;, for &amp;ldquo;Time stretch&amp;rdquo;).
A small adjustment to the length of a Region may not cause noticeable sound Artifacts. However, the more extreme the change in length, the more obvious the effect of processing on the sound.
To use Stretch/Shrink Regions, place your cursor on top of the region, and then Click-drag left or right.</description></item></channel></rss>
