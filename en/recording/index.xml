The source of this audio could be the line or microphone inputs of your audio interface, or it could even be sound originating from other applications on your computer which have been connected to Ardour via JACK. Please see the section on routing for more details.
This section will show you how to record audio from an external source (for example, a microphone) onto a track in Ardour.</description></item><item><title>Recording MIDI</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/recording/recording-midi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/recording/recording-midi/</guid><description>There are several ways to get MIDI into a MIDI track in Ardour apart from importing an existing MIDI file. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at them one by one.
Real-time recording Perhaps the most obvious option to record MIDI into Ardour is connecting a MIDI keyboard to your audio interface or your computer directly and recording whatever you play. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty straightforward process:
Select an existing MIDI track to record to or create a new one</description></item><item><title>Performing on time</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/recording/performing-on-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/recording/performing-on-time/</guid><description>Normally, to record an instrument or a vocal part live, you place the playhead to some position, arm a track for recording, toggle the overall record mode and then roll the transport whenever you are ready. Recording will start at the playhead position, and you will listen the audible part of the session material that also starts at that point. There are two important considerations here.
Using a metronome You might not yet have the beats part of the material to guide you when you are recording.</description></item><item><title>Understanding routing</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/recording/understanding-routing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/recording/understanding-routing/</guid><description>Routing an audio signal is sending it from somewhere to somewhere else.
In addition to getting audio signals to and from Ardour, routing plays an important part inside Ardour itself. Examples of using routing inside Ardour include routing audio from tracks to the Master bus or to other busses, creating &amp;lsquo;sends&amp;rsquo;, routing the outputs from busses to the Master bus, etc. (see chapter on Creating a Track for an explanation of tracks and busses).</description></item><item><title>Routing between applications</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/recording/routing-between-applications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/recording/routing-between-applications/</guid><description>Sometimes you may need to record the audio output of another program into Ardour, e.g. the sound of a YouTube video playing in Firefox, or the output of SuperCollider or PureData. This chapter shows how to accomplish that.
The examples on this page were created on a computer running Ubuntu Linux. Beware that things may work differently if you are on another OS (in particular if you are using a Mac).</description></item></channel></rss>
