The source of this audio could be the line or microphone inputs of your audio interface, or it could even be sound originating from other applications on your computer which have been connected to Ardour via JACK. Please see the section on routing for more details.
This section will show you how to record audio from an external source (for example, a microphone) onto a track in Ardour.</description></item><item><title>Understanding routing</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/recording-audio/understanding-routing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/recording-audio/understanding-routing/</guid><description>Routing an audio signal is sending it from somewhere to somewhere else.
In addition to getting audio signals to and from Ardour, routing plays an important part inside Ardour itself. Examples of using routing inside Ardour include routing audio from Tracks to the Master Bus or to other Busses, creating &amp;lsquo;sends&amp;rsquo;, routing the outputs from Busses to the Master Bus, etc. (see chapter on Creating a Track for an explanation of Tracks and Busses).</description></item><item><title>Routing between applications</title><link>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/recording-audio/routing-between-applications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prokoudine.github.io/ardour-tutorial/en/recording-audio/routing-between-applications/</guid><description>Sometimes you may need to record the audio output of another program into Ardour (for example, the sound of a YouTube video playing in Firefox, or the output of SuperCollider or PureData). This chapter shows how to accomplish that.
The examples on this page were created on a computer running Ubuntu Linux. Beware that things may work differently if you are on another OS (in particular if you are using a Mac, in which case you will be using JackPilot).</description></item></channel></rss>
